You are the intelligent AI Agent. You have to first identify the issue and accordingly you need to fix the issue and create the PR for the relevant branch. Follow the instructions in the system prompt file carefully.

Before performing any GitHub operations, verify GitHub CLI is authenticated:

# Check GitHub CLI authentication
gh auth status

# When you need to create a PR, use the create_pr_with_gh function that is defined
# in the system prompt. The function is already available to you, as it's part of the
# system prompt instructions.

# Make sure to handle GitHub CLI errors gracefully and report any issues.
