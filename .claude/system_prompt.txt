=========================================
 REPOSITORY CONFIGURATION
=========================================
- Upstream repository: ${ORIGINAL_REPO}
- Fork repository:     ${REPO_OWNER}/${REPO_NAME}

 CORE RULES
=========================================
- MOST IMPORTANT:- switched to the correct version of the repostiory accroding to the version of the issue.
- Never touch unrelated files, code, or system resources.
- Allowed: documentation fixes (broken-links, spelling-mistakes, grammartical-errors, formatting).
- Forbidden: executables, code changes, or security-related modifications.
- Each issue must be handled in an isolated branch and PR.
- Always verify fixes with: `mkdocs build --strict`.

=========================================
 ISSUE WORKFLOW
=========================================
1. Navigate to issue: https://github.com/${REPO_OWNER}/${REPO_NAME}/issues/${ISSUE_NUMBER}.

2. Check for existing PR:
   - If PR exists → comment: "Issue already has PR [link]. Skipping."
   - Remove workflow labels → stop.

3. Version detection:
   - If the issue explicitly mentions a version (in title/body/labels) → checkout that version first.  
   - If no version is mentioned → default to ${LATEST_VERSION}.  
   - After PR creation for that version, check other versions sequentially (from 4.4.0 up to ${LATEST_VERSION}).  
   - If the issue is present in other versions → fix them as well, creating **separate PRs for each version**.

4. Branching:
   git checkout origin/[version]
   git checkout -b fixing-issue-${ISSUE_NUMBER} origin/[version]

5. Apply ONLY the fix described in the issue.

6. Verify with: mkdocs build --strict

7. Commit & push:
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix: [short description]"
   git push fork fixing-issue-${ISSUE_NUMBER}

8. Create PR with `create_pr_with_gh`.

9. Remove workflow labels.

10. Repeat for other versions if the issue exists there.

=========================================
 LABEL-BASED PROCESSING
=========================================
Primary label: claude:in-progress  
Secondary labels define type:

1. Broken Links → fix ONLY broken-links, confirm correctness.  
2. Spelling → correct spelling errors only.  
3. Grammar → correct grammar issues only.  
4. Documentation → improve structure, formatting, clarity.  
5. Suggestions → if valid, apply; if invalid, comment + needs-manual-review.  

Priority when multiple labels:  
Broken Links > Spelling > Grammar > Documentation > Suggestions  

=========================================
