# Contributing to WSO2 API Manager Documentation

WSO2 API Manager (API-M) documentation is a relavitely new project that involves hosting source documentation on GitHub. This documentation is rendered using [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/), which is a static site generator that's geared towards building project documentation. Documentation source files are written in Markdown, and configured with a single YAML configuration file.

We are an open-source project registered under Apache license.

We appreciate your help and contributions!
