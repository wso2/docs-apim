# Step 7: Monitor Statistics

This step shows how you can monitor the CDC and file statistics of the WSO2 Streaming Integrator deployment you started and the `SweetFactoryApp` Siddhi application you created and deployed in the previous steps. For this purpose, you are using the some of the pre-configured dashboards provided by WSO2 Streaming Integrator. You can host these dashboards in Grafana and view statistices related to ETL activities carried out by the Streaming Integrator.For more information about these dashboards, see [Monitoring ETL Statistics with Grafana]({{base_path}}/observe/si-observe/viewing-dashboards)

## Configuring WSO2 SI to visualize statistics

To be able to see visualizations of statistics generated by WSO2 Streaming Integrator, you are required to download and install Prometheus and Grafana. You need to download the required pre-configured dashboards and import them to Grafana.

### Downloading the required dashboards

WSO2 Streaming Integrator provides you with pre-configured dashboards in JSON format. You can import these dashboards bto Grafana to view statistics of your Streaming Integrator deployment.

For this scenario, download the following dashboards:

- [WSO2 Streaming Integrator - Overall Statistics.json](https://github.com/wso2/streaming-integrator/blob/master/modules/distribution/carbon-home/resources/dashboards/overview-statistics/WSO2%20Streaming%20Integrator%20-%20Overall%20Statistics.json)

- [WSO2 Streaming Integrator - App Statistics.json](https://github.com/wso2/streaming-integrator/blob/master/modules/distribution/carbon-home/resources/dashboards/overview-statistics/WSO2%20Streaming%20Integrator%20-%20App%20Statistics.json)

### Downloading and setting up Prometheus

WSO2 Streaming Integrator uses Perometheus to expose its statistics to Grafana. Therefore, to download and configure Prometheus, follow the steps below:

1. Download Prometheus from the [Prometheus site](https://prometheus.io/download/). For instructions, see [the Prometheus Getting Started Guide](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/getting_started/).

2. Extract the downloaded file. The directory that opens as a result is referred to as the `<PROMETHEUS_HOME>` from here on.

3. To enable statistics for the Prometheus reporter, open the `<SI_HOME>/conf/server/deployment.yaml` file and set the `enabled` parameter in the `wso2.metrics` section to `true`, and update the other parameters in the section as shown below. You also need to add the `metrics.prometheus:` as shown.

    ```
     wso2.metrics:
       # Enable Metrics
       enabled: true
       reporting:
         console:
           - # The name for the Console Reporter
             name: Console
    
             # Enable Console Reporter
             enabled: false
    
             # Polling Period in seconds.
             # This is the period for polling metrics from the metric registry and printing in the console
             pollingPeriod: 2
    
     metrics.prometheus:
      reporting:
        prometheus:
          - name: prometheus
            enabled: true
            serverURL: "http://localhost:9005"
    ```
   
4. Open the `<PROMETHEUS_HOME>/prometheus.yml` file and add the following configuration in the `scrape_configs:` section.

    ```
     scrape_configs:
       - job_name: 'prometheus'
         static_configs:
         - targets: ['localhost:9005']
    ```
   
5. In the terminal, navigate to the `<PROMETHEUS_HOME` and issue the following command to start the Prometheus server.

    `./prometheus`
    
!!! info
    The above steps to configure and start Prometheus need to be performed before you start the Grafana server.
    
### Downloading and setting up Grafana

The pre-configured dashboards provided by WSO2 Streaming Integrator which you previously downloaded are rendered in Grafana to visualize statistics. To download and set up Grafana, follow the steps below:

!!! tip "Before you begin:"
    Start the Prometheus server as instructed under [Downloading and setting up Prometheus](#downloading-and-setting-up-prometheus).

1. Download Grafana from the [Grafana Labs - Download Grafana](https://grafana.com/grafana/download).

2. Start Grafana.

    !!! info
        The procedure to start Grafana depends on your operating system and the installation process. e.g., If your operating system is Mac OS and you have installed Grafana via Homebrew, you start Grafana by issuing the `brew services start grafana` command.
        
3. In the **Data Sources** section, click **Add your first data source**. In the **Add data source** page that appears, click **Select** for **Prometheus**.
       
4. In the **Add data source** page -> **Settings** tab, update the configurations for Prometheus as follows.<br/>   
   ![prometheus configuration]({{base_path}}/assets/img/streaming/cdc-monitoring/prometheus-configurations.png)<br/>    
   1. Click **Default** to make Prometheus the default data source.
   
   2. Under **HTTP**, enter `http://localhost:9090` as the URL.
   
   3. Click **Save & Test**. If the data source is successfully configured, it is indicated via a message.
       ![Save and Test]({{base_path}}/assets/img/streaming/cdc-monitoring/save-and-test.png)
       
   4. To import the dashboards that you previously downloaded as JSON files, follow the procedure below:
   
    1. Start Grafana and access it via http://localhost:3000/.
        
    2. To load a new dashboard, click the plus icon **(+)** in the side panel. Then click **Import**.
        
    3. In the **Import** page, click **Upload .json** file. Then browse and select the .json file of the preconfigured dashboard that you downloaded (i.e., in step 5, substep 1).
        
    4. If required, change the unique identifier displayed in the **Unique Identifier (uid)**.
        
    5. Click **Import**.
    
## Enable the Siddhi application to publish statistics
    
To enable the `SweetFactoryApp` Siddhi application to publish statistics to Prometheus, add the `@App:statistics(reporter = 'prometheus')` annotation to it below the `@App:name` annotation as shown below:

    ```text
        @App:name('SweetFactoryApp')
        @App:statistics(reporter = 'prometheus')
    ```
!!! tip 
    You can update the Siddhi application in Streaming Integrator Tooling and deploy it again in the Streaming Integrator server as you did in [Step 5: Update the Siddhi Application](update-the-siddhi-application.md).
    
## Viewing statistics

To generate some statistics and view them, follow the procedure below.

1. Start WSO2 Streaming Integrator.

2. To generate statistics, insert as many events as you want into the `SweetProductionTable` MySQL table that you created for this scenario in [Step 1: Download Streaming Integrator and Dependencies](download-install-and-start-si.md). Also, manually add as many rows as you want in the `/Users/foo/productioninserts.csv` file.

3. Access Grafana via the `localhost:3000` URL.

4. In the side panel, click the **Dashboards** icon and click **Dashboards**.
