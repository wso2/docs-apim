# Security Guidelines for Production Deployment

Given below are the common security guidelines for deploying a WSO2 product in a **production environment**.

In addition, see the [production deployment guidelines]({{base_path}}/install-and-setup/deploying-wso2-api-manager/production-deployment-guidelines) and any other product-specific guidelines that might come in the respective product's documentation.

<td><p>Apply security updates</p></td>
<td><p>Apply all the security patches relevant to your product version. WSO2 Update Manager (WUM) supports WSO2 API Manager 2.1.0 onwards in order to get updates. Therefore, you need to use WUM to get the latest security patches.</p>
<ul>
<li>Follow the instructions in <a href="https://docs.wso2.com/display/updates/Getting+Started">Getting Started with 
WUM</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note the following:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>WSO2 releases security patch notifications monthly via the Support Portal. However, WSO2 issues patches immediately to customers if there are highly 
critical issues.</li>
<li>WSO2 does not issue patches publicly for older product versions. Community users are encouraged to use the 
latest product version to receive all the security issues resolved until that particular product release.</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>Change default keystores</p></td>
<td><p>Change the default key stores and create new keys for all the cryptographic operations. WSO2 products by default come with a self-signed SSL key. As these keys are public, it is recommended to configure your own keys for security purposes. Consider the following guidelines when creating the keystores:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Select a key size of at least 2048 bits.</p></li>
<li><p>Use an SHA256 certificate.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure that WSO2 default certificates do not exist in any of the keystores in your production environment. For example, be sure to delete the default public certificate in the default trust store that is shipped with the product.</p></li>

products, see <a href="{{base_path}}/install-and-setup/setup/security/configuring-keystores/keystore-basics/about-asymetric-cryptography/">About Asymmetric Cryptography</a>.<br />

For example, the default HTTPS port is 9443 and the HTTP port is 9763. In addition, Axis2 services are exposed over the following ports: 8243 and 8280.</p>

<td><p>Connect to data stores using a less privileged user</p></td>
<td><p>When connecting the WSO2 product to external databases or user stores (LDAP), be sure to go through a user who does not have permission to change the data store's schema.

<td><p>Configure strong HTTP(S) security</p></td>
<td><p>To have strong transport-level security, use  disable SSL protocol versions and enable only TLS protocol

<code>sslEnabledProtocols="TLSv1,TLSv1.1,TLSv1.2"</code> under <code>[transport.https.sslHostConfig
.properties]</code> in the <code>deployment.toml</code> file. In addition, configure strong ciphers for

<li>When deciding on the TLS protocol and the ciphers, consider the compatibility with existing client applications. Imposing maximum security might cause functional problems with client applications.</li>
<li>Apply ciphers with 256 bits key length if you have applied the Unlimited strength policy. Note that Unlimited strength policy is recommended.</li>
<li>Also, consider the following factors when deciding on the ciphers:
<ul>
<li>DES/3DES are deprecated and should not be used.</li>
<li>MD5 should not be used, due to known collision attacks.</li>
<li>RC4 should not be used, due to crypto-analytical attacks.</li>
<li>DSS is limited to a small 1024 bit key size.</li>
<li>Cipher-suites that do not provide Perfect Forward Secrecy/ Forward Secrecy (PFS/FS).</li>

<p>Note that (for WSO2 products based on Carbon 4.4.11 or later versions which implies API-M 2.1.0 and newer) HSTS is disabled for the applications with which the product is shipped by default.

<p>You need to make sure that only administrative users have access to the product's management console. Further, 
instead of granting all permission to one administrator, you can distribute the responsibilities among administrators by assigning different permissions for conducting various tasks.</p>

<td><p>Enable the Firewall</p></td>
<td><p>Enable a firewall at the OS level (for example, <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IptablesHowTo">iptables</a>).

<td>Session Data Cleanup</td>
<td>
<div style="background-color:#ffffff; padding: 10px;">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This security guideline is specific only to WSO2 Identity Server.</p>

<p>In a production environment, there is a possibility for a deadlock or a database lock to occur when running a session 
data cleanup task in high load scenarios. To mitigate this, configure the following property to clean data in chunks.
 Configure this property in the <code&lt;IS_HOME&gt;/repository/conf/deployment.toml</code> file under
  <code>session_data</code> with the required chunk size. This value is in the number of records and depends on the database type and server capacity. It also depends on the amount of load generated by single sign-on (SSO). A higher value increases the chances of deadlocks and a lower value increases the time it takes for a cleanup.</p>

<ul>
<li>The &quot;/services&quot; context is used in WSO2 products to expose admin services. These admin services are used for performing administrative operations using SOAP requests.</li>
<li>The &quot;/carbon&quot; context is used in WSO2 products to expose the management console (administration console) of the product. The management console is a user interface for performing some of the administrative operations of a product.</li>
<li>In addition to the &quot;/services&quot; and &quot;/carbon&quot; contexts, be sure to expose only the required applications in your product to users beyond the DMZ level in your network.</li>
