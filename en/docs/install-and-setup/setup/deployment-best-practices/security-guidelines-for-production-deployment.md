# Security Guidelines for Production Deployment

Given below are the common security guidelines for deploying a WSO2 API Manager in a **production environment**.

In addition, see the [production deployment checklist]({{base_path}}/install-and-setup/setup/deployment-best-practices/production-deployment-guidelines) and any other product-specific guidelines in the respective product's documentation.

-   [Runtime-level security](#runtime-level-security)
-   [OS-level security](#os-level-security)
-   [Network-level security](#network-level-security)

## Runtime-level security

Given below are the security guidelines for the API-M and Micro Integrator runtimes. Note that some of these guidelines are common to both runtimes, whereas some guidelines are runtime-specific.

### API-M runtime security

Given below are the security guidelines for the API-M runtime.

<p><strong>Note the following:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>WSO2 releases security patch notifications monthly via the Support Portal. However, WSO2 issues patches immediately to customers if there are highly 
critical issues.</li>
<li>WSO2 does not issue patches publicly for older product versions. Community users are encouraged to use the

<tr class="even">
<td><p>Change default keystores</p></td>
<td><p>Change the default key stores and create new keys for all the cryptographic operations. WSO2 products, by default, come with a self-signed SSL key. As these keys are public, it is recommended to configure your own keys for security purposes. Consider the following guidelines when creating the keystores:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Select a key size of at least 2048 bits.</p></li>
<li><p>Use an SHA256 certificate.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure that WSO2 default certificates do not exist in any of the keystores in your production environment. For example, be sure to delete the default public certificate in the default trust store that is shipped with the product.</p></li>

  <p>To have strong transport-level security, disable SSL protocol versions and enable only TLS protocol

<code>sslEnabledProtocols="TLSv1,TLSv1.1,TLSv1.2"</code> under <code>[transport.https.sslHostConfig
.properties]</code> in the <code>deployment.toml</code> file. In addition, configure strong ciphers for

<p>Note that (for WSO2 products based on Carbon 4.4.11 or later versions, which implies API-M 2.1.0 and newer) HSTS is disabled for the applications with which the product is shipped by default.

<p>You need to make sure that only administrative users have access to the product's management console. Further, 
instead of granting all permission to one administrator, you can distribute the responsibilities among administrators by assigning different permissions for conducting various tasks.</p>

## OS-level security

<tr class="header">
<th>Guideline</th>
<th>Details</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Run WSO2 processes with a specific OS-level user</p></td>
<td><p>Use a separate OS-level user to run WSO2 products. Make sure that the user is only granted the permissions required for running the product for that particular user. Do not use the root/administrator user of your OS because the root/administrator is granted all privileges by default.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>Minimize software to avoid vulnerability</p></td>
<td><p>Make sure that you only install the software/packages that are relevant to your WSO2 product's deployment. Also, continuously monitor the software that you install.</p>
<p>For information on the minimum software that your WSO2 product will need, see <a href="{{base_path}}/install-and-setup/install/installation-prerequisites/#system-requirements">Installation Prerequisites</a>.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Enable the Firewall</p></td>
<td><p>Enable a firewall at the OS level (for example, <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IptablesHowTo">iptables</a>). This will provide protection for inbound and outbound connections of your WSO2 product. Make sure that you only open the required outbound and inbound ports from the OS-level firewall.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Restrict access to TCP ports used for clustering</td>
<td>Apply a firewall at the host-level to disallow access to TCP ports used for clustering (port 4000, 4001, … by default) from unrecognized hosts. These ports should be accessible only from other members of the WSO2 product cluster.</td>
</tr>

<td><p>Use Secure Shell(SSH)</p>

</p></td>
<td><p>Use Secure Shell (SSH) when interacting with servers and executing commands. Adhere to the following best practices when you configure SSH:</p>
<ul>
<li>Change the default SSH port to a higher value.</li>
<li>Disable the root or administrator.</li>
<li>Enable login with user keys.</li>
<li>Display a legal banner or a security banner with security warnings before SSH authentication.</li>
</ul></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>Keep the system up-to-date</p></td>

</tr>
<tr class="odd">

<td>Session Data Cleanup</td>
<td>
<div style="background-color:#ffffff; padding: 10px;">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This security guideline is only applicable to WSO2 Identity Server.</p>

<p>In a production environment, there is a possibility for a deadlock or a database lock to occur when running a session 
data cleanup task in high load scenarios. To mitigate this, configure the following property to clean data in chunks.
 Configure this property in the <code&lt;IS_HOME&gt;/repository/conf/deployment.toml</code> file under
  <code>session_data</code> with the required chunk size. This value is in the number of records and depends on the database type and server capacity. It also depends on the amount of load generated by single sign-on (SSO). A higher value increases the chances of deadlocks and a lower value increases the time it takes for a cleanup.</p>
<pre class="java" data-syntaxhighlighter-params="brush: java; gutter: false; theme: Confluence" data-theme="Confluence" style="brush: java; gutter: false; theme: Confluence"><code>[session_data]

<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Create a failover setup</p>
<p><br />
</p></td>
<td>In the cloud native deployment, high-availability should be achieved via the container orchestration system (e.g., Kubernetes ). 
<p>In a VM deployment, there should be atleast two nodes with the failover configuration. When your servers are clustered, you need to regularly monitor the health of your server instances. For example, you need to monitor resource-level factors such as the server's resource utilization, response time anomalies, and the number of incoming network connections. Server monitoring will help you identify when additional server instances (failover instances) are required. You can also make decisions about network routing changes that you need to do in order to avoid server downtime.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>Maintain network-level logging</p></td>
<td><p>Be sure to maintain and monitor logs for your proxy servers, load balancers, and other network devices.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Check open ports and services</p></td>
<td><p>Periodically check for open ports using port scanning tools and make sure that only the necessary ports are open to both internal and external networks. Be sure that only the ports relevant to your WSO2 products are open for communication. If there are other ports started, be sure to monitor them.</p>
<p>For the full list of ports in all WSO2 products, see <a href="{{base_path}}/install-and-setup/setup/reference/default-product-ports/">Default Product Ports</a>.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>Configure device-level security</p></td>

<td><p>Apply firmware updates</p></td>
<td><p>Firmware updates for your network devices should be applied regularly.</p></td>
</tr>

<td>
<p><strong>Note:</strong>This security guideline is applicable to the API-M runtime.</p>
<p>Block the <code>/services</code> and <code>/carbon</code> contexts from the DMZ</p></td>
<td><p>Access to the &quot;/services&quot; and &quot;/carbon&quot; contexts should be blocked from the DMZ level (i.e., from the proxy server, load balancer and/or firewall).</p>
<ul>
<li>The &quot;/services&quot; context is used in WSO2 products to expose admin services. These admin services are used for performing administrative operations using SOAP requests.</li>
<li>The &quot;/carbon&quot; context is used in WSO2 products to expose the management console (administration console) of the product. The management console is a user interface for performing some of the administrative operations of a product.</li>
<li>In addition to the &quot;/services&quot; and &quot;/carbon&quot; contexts, be sure to expose only the required applications in your product to users beyond the DMZ level in your network.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> </p>
<p>It is recommended to use an allowlisting approach when allowing access to resources in your product from the DMZ level.</p>
