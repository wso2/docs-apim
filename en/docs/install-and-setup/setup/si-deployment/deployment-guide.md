# Deployment

WSO2 Streaming Integrator(SI) is designed to deploy enterprise grade critical systems that demand high 
reliability, availability and performance. Thus, WSO2 SI is designed with support for deployment options that can 
handle increasing system loads (scalability) and provide near-zero downtime by eliminating single points of failure 
(high availability). Furthermore, some of the key characteristics of WSO2 SI deployment architecture are ease of 
installation and deployment, high maintainability, and DevOps-friendliness.

The main deployment patterns supported are:

 - [Single Node Deployment]({{base_path}}/install-and-setup/setup/si-deployment/deploying-si-as-a-single-deployment)
 - [Minimum High Available(HA) Deployment]({{base_path}}/install-and-setup/setup/si-deployment/deploying-si-as-minimum-ha-cluster)
 - [Scalable High Available(HA) Deployment]({{base_path}}/install-and-setup/setup/si-deployment/deploying-si-as-a-scalable-cluster)
