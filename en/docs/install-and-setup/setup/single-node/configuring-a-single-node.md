----------------------------

## Step 1 - Create a SSL Certificate

!!! info   
    All WSO2 products are by default shipped with a keystore file and truststore file stored in the 
    `<PRODUCT_HOME>/repository/resources/security/` directory. The default keystore that is shipped with a WSO2 product, 
    `wso2carbon.jks` is configured with private key and self signed public key pair for all purposes, such as encrypting 
    sensitive information, communicating over SSL etc. 
    
    In a **production setup**, it is advised to set up several different keystores with separate trust chains for different use cases. For more information, see [Recommendations for setting up keystores in WSO2 products]({{base_path}}/administer/product-security/configuring-keystores/configuring-keystores-in-wso2-api-manager/#recommendations-for-setting-up-keystores).

To create an all purpose keystore or multiple keystores for authentication and protection of data, follow the steps in [Creating New Keystores]({{base_path}}/administer/product-security/configuring-keystores/keystore-basics/creating-new-keystores/).

## Step 2 - Configure the Load Balancer

In order to access the WSO2 API-M Portals and Gateway in both WSO2 API-M instances, you need to front the system with a load balancer. You can use any load balancer that is available to your system.

Follow the steps in [Configuring the Proxy Server and the Load Balancer]({{base_path}}/install-and-setup/deploying-wso2-api-manager/configuring-the-proxy-server-and-the-load-balancer) to configure the load balancer/reverse proxy which is fronting the API-M instance in the demiliterized zone (DMZ).

??? tip
    For example, if you are using the hostname `api.am.wso2.com` is used to access all portals (publisher, store, admin, and carbon) and `gw.am.wso2.com` is used to invoke APIs, the `deployment.toml` in `<API-M_HOME>/repository/conf` directory, should have the following reverse proxy configurations.

    **NOTE** : Following is a sample configuration. Therefore parameter values might be different.
    ```toml
    [server]
    hostname = "api.am.wso2.com"
    [transport.https.properties]
    proxyPort = 443
    ```

## Step 3 - Configure the Databases

WSO2 API-M is shipped with H2 databases by default. However, in a **production setup**, it is recommended to use an industry-standard RDBMS databases for  `WSO2AM_DB` and `WSO2SHARED_DB`. For more information on default databases and changing them into RDBMS databases, see [Working with Databases]({{base_path}}/install-and-setup/setting-up-databases/overview/).

??? tip
    If you have configured the apim and shared databases correctly, the `deployment.toml` in `<API-M_HOME>/repository/conf` 
    directory, should have the following configurations.

    **NOTE** : Following is a sample configuration for MySQL 8.0. Therefore parameter values might be different.

    ```toml
    [database.apim_db]
    type = "mysql"
    url = "jdbc:mysql://mysql.wso2.com:3306/WSO2AM_DB?useSSL=false"
    username = "wso2carbon"
    password = "wso2carbon"
    driver="com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver"

    [database.shared_db]
    type = "mysql"
    url = "jdbc:mysql://mysql.wso2.com:3306/WSO2SHARED_DB?useSSL=false"
    username = "wso2carbon"
    password = "wso2carbon"
    driver="com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver"
    ```

## Step 4 - Configure Gateway URLs to Expose APIs

You need to configure the environment URLs which are used to expose the deployed APIs in the Gateway. Add the Gateway 
hostname when you configure environments in the `<API-M_HOME>/repository/conf/deployment.toml` file.Â 

Update the endpoints with your chosen hostname for Gateway as shown below. 
In this case, let's use `gw.am.wso2.com` as the hostname.
    ``` java
    [[apim.gateway.environment]]
    name = "Production and Sandbox"
    type = "hybrid"
    display_in_api_console = true
    description = "This is a hybrid gateway that handles both production and sandbox token traffic."
    show_as_token_endpoint_url = true
    service_url = "https://localhost:${mgt.transport.https.port}/services/"
    username= "${admin.username}"
    password= "${admin.password}"
    ws_endpoint = "ws://gw.am.wso2.com:9099"
    wss_endpoint = "wss://gw.am.wso2.com:8099"
    http_endpoint = "http://gw.am.wso2.com:${http.nio.port}"
    https_endpoint = "https://gw.am.wso2.com:${https.nio.port}"
    ```    
## Step 5 - Configure Dev Portal URL in Publisher

Update the DevPortal URL with your chosen hostname to expose the portals. This is for the redirection of 
`View in Dev Portal` link in Publisher portal.  

In this case, let's use `api.am.wso2.com` as the hostname:
    ```java
    [apim.devportal]
    url = "https://api.am.wso2.com/devportal"
    ```

## Step 6 - Configure API-M Analytics

If you wish to view reports, statistics, and graphs related to the APIs deployed in the WSO2 API Manager, you need to 
configure API-M Analytics. If not, you can **skip this step**.

Follow the [Configuring API-M Anlaytics - Quick Setup]({{base_path}}/observe/api-manager-analytics/configuring-apim-analytics/#quick-setup) to configure API-M Analytics in a development setup and, follow 
[Configuring API-M Analytics - Standard Setup]({{base_path}}/observe/api-manager-analytics/configuring-apim-analytics/#standard-setup) 
to configure API-M Analytics in a production setup.

## Step 7 - Configure Production Hardening

In a **production setup**, ensure that you have taken into account the respective security hardening factors 
(e.g., changing and encrypting the default passwords, configuring JVM security etc.) and other production deployment 
guidelines (e.g., tuning parameters, backup and recovery remmendations etc.) before deploying WSO2 API-M node. 

For more information on security hardening guidelines, see [Security Guidelines for Production Deployment]({{base_path}}/install-and-setup/deploying-wso2-api-manager/security-guidelines-for-production-deployment/).

For more information on other production deployment guidelines, see [Production Deployment Guidelines]({{base_path}}/install-and-setup/deploying-wso2-api-manager/production-deployment-guidelines/#common-guidelines-and-checklist).
  
## Step 8 - Start the WSO2 API-M server

If you want to deploy WSO2 API-M using a hybrid single node deployment, where WSO2 Identity Server is used as the Key Manager while the rest of the WSO2 API-M components are all in one node, configure and start the Key Manager (e.g., configure and start WSO2 Identity Server as the Key Manager) before starting the WSO2 API-M server.


Start the WSO2 API-M servers using the standard start-up script. For more information, see [Starting the server]({{base_path}}/install-and-setup/installation-guide/running-the-product/#starting-the-server).

```tab="Linux/Mac OS"
cd <API-M_HOME>/bin/
sh api-manager.sh
```

```tab="Windows"
cd <API-M_HOME>\bin\
api-manager.bat --run 
```
