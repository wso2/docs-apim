To ensure that the Marketplace Assistant is fully informed about all published APIs and API Products, it is essential to update the vector database.
You can use the **WSO2 API Controller (apictl)** to keep the vector database upto date.

First you have to download and initialize the apictl.

1.  Make sure that the WSO2 API-M is started and that the corresponding version of apictl is set up.   
For more information, see [Download and Initialize the apictl]({{base_path}}/install-and-setup/setup/api-controller/getting-started-with-wso2-api-controller/#download-and-initialize-the-apictl).
2.  Log in to the WSO2 API-M in the environment by following the instructions in [Login to an Environment]({{base_path}}/install-and-setup/setup/api-controller/getting-started-with-wso2-api-controller/#login-to-an-environment).
3.  Run the corresponding apictl commands below to delete and upload APIs and API Products from a logged in user's tenant.

This process can be repeated for all tenants.

If you intend to use the same access token across different deployments, you can continue using it without generating a new one each time.

This process ensures that the Marketplace Assistant is up-to-date with all published APIs, enhancing its ability to provide accurate and relevant assistance.
