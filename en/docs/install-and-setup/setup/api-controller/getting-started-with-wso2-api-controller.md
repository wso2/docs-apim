# Getting Started with WSO2 API Controller (apictl)

**WSO2 API Controller (apictl)** is a command-line tool providing the capability to move APIs, API Products, and Applications across environments and to perform CI/CD operations. It can also be used to perform these same tasks on a Kubernetes deployment. In addition, apictl can be used as a developer CLI tool for Microgateway. Furthermore, it can perform WSO2 Micro Integrator (WSO2 MI) server specific operations such as monitoring Synapse artifacts and performing MI management/administrative tasks from the command line.

## Download and initialize the apictl

1.  Download **apictl** based on your preferred platform (i.e., Mac, Windows, Linux).

    - [For MacOS]({{base_path}}/assets/attachments/learn/api-controller/apictl-3.2.1-macosx-x64.tar.gz)
    - [For Linux 32-bit]({{base_path}}/assets/attachments/learn/api-controller/apictl-3.2.1-linux-i586.tar.gz)
    - [For Linux 64-bit]({{base_path}}/assets/attachments/learn/api-controller/apictl-3.2.1-linux-x64.tar.gz)
    - [For Windows 32-bit]({{base_path}}/assets/attachments/learn/api-controller/apictl-3.2.1-windows-i586.zip)
    - [For Windows 64-bit]({{base_path}}/assets/attachments/learn/api-controller/apictl-3.2.1-windows-x64.zip)

2.  Extract the downloaded archive of the apictl to the desired location.
3.  Navigate to the working directory where the executable apictl resides.
4.  Execute the following command to start the apictl.

    !!! Warn
        If you have previously used an apictl old version, backup and remove `/home/<user>/.wso2apictl` directory and reconfigure the environments using the commands as explained below in [Add an environment](#add-an-environment) section.

    ``` go
    ./apictl
    ```

    The directory structure for the configuration files (`<USER_HOME>/.wso2apictl`) will be created upon the execution of the `apictl` command.

    !!! Tip
        If you want to change the default location for the .wso2apictl directory, set an environment variable (**APICTL_CONFIG_DIR**) as follows with the path for the desired location.

        ```
        export APICTL_CONFIG_DIR="/home/wso2user/CLI"
        ```

5.  Add the location of the extracted folder to your system's `$PATH` variable to be able to access the executable from anywhere.

    !!! Tip    
        For further instructions, execute the following command.
        
        ``` go
        apictl --help
        ```

## Global flags for apictl

The following are some global flags that you can use with any apictl command.

``` go
--verbose
    Enable verbose logs (Provides more information on execution)
--insecure, -k
    Allow connections to SSL sites without certs
--help, -h
    Display information and example usage of a command
```

## Check the version of the apictl

Run the following apictl command to check the version.

-   **Command**
    ```bash
    apictl version
    ```
-   **Response**

    ```bash
    Version: 4.0.0
    Build Date: 2020-12-11 13:22:12 UTC
    ```

!!!note
    **Set mode of apictl**

    From the apictl 4.0.0 onwards the flag (--mode) which was used to set the mode of apictl has been deprecated. Now, you do not need to set the mode of apictl, because if you want to execute Kubernetes based commads, you just need to add the `k8s` keyword after `apictl` keyword. (Example: `apictl k8s add api`). By default apictl will execute the commands in the `default` mode (which means if you did not use `k8s` keyword).

    You can still use the `mode` flag as explained below if you need it, but it will be removed in the future.
        
    -   **Command**

        ```go
        apictl set --mode <mode>
        ```

        !!! example

            ``` go
            apictl set --mode default
            ```
            ``` go
            apictl set --mode kubernetes
            ```

         The allowed modes are `default` and `kubernetes`. 

## Set proxy environment variables for apictl

You can set proxy related `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, `http_proxy`, and `https_proxy` standard environment variables, with or without basic authentication as shown below to send the requests initiated from CTL via a proxy server. After one of the following environment variables is set in your environment where CTL is used, all the requests will go through the proxy server specified.

-   **Formats**

    ``` bash tab="Without Basic Authentication"
    export HTTP_PROXY="http://<host-name>:<port>"

    export HTTPS_PROXY="https://<host-name>:<port>"

    export http_proxy="http://<host-name>:<port>"

    export https_proxy="https://<host-name>:<port>"
    ```

    ``` bash tab="With Basic Authentication"
    export HTTP_PROXY="http://<username>:<password>@<host-name>:<port>"

    export HTTPS_PROXY="https://<username>:<password>@<host-name>:<port>"

    export http_proxy="http://<username>:<password>@<host-name>:<port>"

    export https_proxy="https://<username>:<password>@<host-name>:<port>"
    ```

-   **Examples**

    ``` bash tab="Without Basic Authentication"
    export HTTP_PROXY="http://localhost:3128"

    export HTTPS_PROXY="https://localhost:3128"

    export http_proxy="http://localhost:3128"

    export https_proxy="https://localhost:3128"
    ```

    ``` bash tab="With Basic Authentication"
    export HTTP_PROXY="http://testuser:password@localhost:3128"

    export HTTPS_PROXY="https://testuser:password@localhost:3128"

    export http_proxy="http://testuser:password@localhost:3128"

    export https_proxy="https://testuser:password@localhost:3128"
    ```

## Add an environment
        
You can add environments by either manually editing the `<USER_HOME>/.wso2apictl/main_config.yaml` file or by running the following apictl command.

``` go
apictl add env <environment-name>
```

1.  Make sure that the WSO2 API Manager (WSO2 API-M) 4.0.0 version is started and that the 4.0.0 version of apictl is set up.     
For more information, see [Download and Initialize the apictl](#download-and-initialize-the-apictl).
2.  Run the following apictl command to add an environment.

    -   **Command**

        ``` bash tab="Linux/Unix"
        apictl add env <environment-name> \
                       --registration <client-registration-endpoint> \
                       --apim <API-Manager-endpoint> \
                       --token <token-endpoint> \
                       --admin <admin-REST-API-endpoint> \
                       --publisher <publisher-portal-endpoint> \
                       --devportal <developer-portal-endpoint> \
                       --mi <mi-management-endpoint>
        ```

        ``` bash tab="Mac/Windows"
        apictl add env <environment-name> --registration <client-registration-endpoint> --apim <API-Manager-endpoint> --token <token-endpoint> --admin <admin-REST-API-endpoint> --publisher <publisher-portal-endpoint> --devportal <developer-portal-endpoint> --mi <mi-management-endpoint>
        ```

        !!! info
            **Flags:**  
            
            **To add a WSO2 API-M**

            -    Required :     
                (either)     
                `--apim` : API Manager endpoint for the environments     
                OR (the following 4)     
                `--registration` : Registration endpoint for the environment     
                `--admin` : Admin endpoint for the environment     
                `--publisher` : Publisher Portal endpoint for the environment     
                `--devportal` : Developer Portal endpoint for the environment     

            -   Optional :     
                `--token` : Token endpoint for the environment

            **To add a WSO2 MI**

            -    Required :     
                `--mi` : Management endpoint of the Micro Integrator
            
        !!! tip
            When adding an environment, when the optional flags are not given, apictl will automatically derive those from `--apim` flag value.

        !!! note
            You can either provide only the flag `--apim` , or all the other 4 flags (`--registration`, `--publisher`, `--devportal`, `--admin`) without providing `--apim` flag.
            If you are omitting any of `--registration`, `--publisher`, `--devportal`, `--admin` flags, you need to specify `--apim` flag with the WSO2 API-M endpoint.
            In both of the above cases `--token`  flag is optional and can be used to provide a user-preferred token endpoint.
            You can use the `--mi` flag to add a Micro Integrator instance to an environment.

## Import SSL certificates for Secure HTTP communication with WSO2 API-M

Different environments of WSO2 API-M can have different SSL certificates for secure HTTP communications. The default
certificate of WSO2 API-M is a self-signed certificate and in production environments, it is advised to use a
different certificate than the default.   

If the certificate is the default WSO2 certificate or a CA-signed certificate of a CA (Certificate Authority) trusted by
the OS, these certificates will be imported by default to apictl. If the CA or the certificate is new or does
not get imported by default, you can add the certificate to the ```certs``` directory found in 
`APICTL_CONFIG_DIR/.wso2apictl`. 
(The default location of the certs directory is `/home/.wso2apictl/certs`)  

The certificates added to this directory will be imported whenever an action is performed with apictl. Any
DER or PEM encoded certificate with the file extensions of ```*.pem```, ```*.crt``` or ```*.cer``` can be used with apictl.

!!! Info
    If you are using Windows, CA certs will not be imported by default and have to be added to the ```certs``` directory.
