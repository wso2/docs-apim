# Deploy on Kubernetes

You can set up a Kubernetes cluster for the Micro Integrator in two ways: 

-	Generate the Kubernetes resources for your integrations deployed in a Micro Integrator and create the Kubernetes cluster using those resources. This is the bare-metal approach to setting up a Kubernetes deployment. 
-	Use the API K8s Operator of WSO2 API Manager and automate the deployment.
