# Install and Setup Overview

The installation and the setup of API Manager involves installing the product, deploying it in the method that is best suited for your requirements, and setting it up to run in the production environment. If you already have an older version of WSO2 API Manager or one of its components, you can follow the upgrading instructions in this guide.

This section provides installation and setup instructions for the following three components of WSO2 API Manager that you need to operate as three separate runtimes.

## API Manager

This component manages APIs. To install and set up this component, see the following topics.

### Installing

To install and run the API Manager in virtual machines and containerized environments, see the following topics.

### Deploying

The API Manager component can be deployed in multiple deployment patterns. Some of these patterns allow the API manager to be deployed with the other components (i.e., the Micro Integrator and the Streaming Integrator), whereas the other patterns involve deploying only the sub components of the API Manager component. For more information, see the topics below.
