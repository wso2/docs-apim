# Installing via the Binary

Follow the steps given below to install the WSO2 Streaming Integrator runtime by using the <b>binary distribution</b>.

## Download and install

Go to the [product page](https://wso2.com/integration/#), click **Download**, and then click **Zip Archive** to download the product distribution as a ZIP file.

Extract the download ZIP file to a location on your computer. The <b>streaming-integrator</b> folder inside the extracted ZIP file will be your <b>SI_HOME</b> directory.

## Running the SI server

### Starting the SI server

1.  Open a terminal and navigate to the `<SI_HOME>/bin/` directory, where `<SI_HOME>` is the home directory of the distribution you downloaded.

2.  Execute the relevant command:

    ```bash tab='On MacOS/Linux/CentOS'
    sh server.sh
    ```
    
    ```bash tab='On Windows'
    server.bat --run
    ```
      
By default, the HTTP listener port is 8290 and the default HTTPS listener port is 8253.
