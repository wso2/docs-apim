## Before you begin

Follow the steps given below before you start.

1.  Download and install the servers:

    -     [Download and install]({{base_path}}/install-and-setup/install/installing-the-product/installing-mi-dashboard) the Micro Integrator dashboard.
    -     [Download and install]({{base_path}}/install-and-setup/install/installing-the-product/installing-mi) the Micro Integrator.

2.  Set up the Micro Integrator:

    1.  Open the `deployment.toml` file (stored in the `<MI_HOME>/conf/` folder) of the Micro Integrator, and add the following configuration.

        ```toml
        [dashboard_config]
        dashboard_url = "https://localhost:9743/dashboard/api/"
        heartbeat_interval = 5
        group_id = "mi_dev"
        node_id = "dev_node_2"
        ```

    2.  Be sure to change the host and port number of the `dashboard_url` in the above configuration if you have changed the default host and port for the dashboard.
