# Setting up the ServiceNow Instance

The ServiceNow connector allows you to access the ServiceNow REST API from an integration sequence. To use the REST API, we need to have a [ServiceNow](https://www.servicenow.com/) account. 

## Signing Up for Servicenow

1. Visit [ServiceNow](https://www.servicenow.com/) site and sign up for an account and do the verification step. 

2. Now you need to create an instance. To do that visit [ServiceNow Developer account](https://developer.servicenow.com/dev.do) with the credentials you obtained when following the previous step. Click on the **Request Instance** button.
