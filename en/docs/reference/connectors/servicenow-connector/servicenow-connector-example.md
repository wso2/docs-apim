# ServiceNow Connector Example

The WSO2 ServiceNow connector allows you to access the ServiceNow REST API from an integration sequence. Using ServiceNow connector you can work with Aggregate API, Import Set API and Table API in ServiceNow. You can further read about ServiceNow REST APIs from [here](https://developer.servicenow.com/dev.do#!/reference/api/orlando/rest/c_TableAPI).

## What you'll build

This example explains how to use ServiceNow Connector to create records in a table and retrieve its information. Assume your organization uses ServiceNow support and you need to create an incident. In order to do that we can use the tableAPI, which is a REST API. This can be easily done using WSO2 ServiceNow connector. Whenever you need to raise an incident at ServiceNow, the above API can be called with the required information.

It will have two HTTP API resources, which are `postRecord` and `readRecord`. 

<img src="{{base_path}}/assets/img/integrate/connectors/servicenow.png" title="ServiceNow Scenario" width="800" alt="ServiceNow Scenario"/>

* `/postRecord`: It creates a new record in the existing incident table in the ServiceNow instance.

* `/readRecord `: It reads the detailed information about the created incident record in the incident table.

If you do not want to configure this yourself, you can simply [get the project](#get-the-project) and run it.

## Setting up the environment 

Please follow the steps mentioned in the [Setting up ServiceNow Instance]({{base_path}}/reference/connectors/servicenow-connector/settingup-servicenow-instance/) document in order to create a ServiceNow Instance and obtain the credentials. Keep them saved to be used in the next steps.  

## Configure the connector in WSO2 Integration Studio

Follow these steps to set up the Integration Project and the Connector Exporter Project. 

{!reference/connectors/importing-connector-to-integration-studio.md!} 

1. First let's create postRecord sequence and ReadRecord sequences. Right click on the created Integration Project and select, -> **New** -> **Sequence** to create the Sequence. 
    <img src="{{base_path}}/assets/img/integrate/connectors/add-sequence.png" title="Adding a Sequence" width="800" alt="Adding a Sequence"/>

2. Provide the Sequence name as PostRecord. You can go to the source view of the XML configuration file of the API and copy the following configuration. 
    ```xml
      <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
      <sequence name="PostRecord" trace="disable" xmlns="http://ws.apache.org/ns/synapse">
      <servicenow.init>
          <serviceNowInstanceURL>https://dev55707.service-now.com</serviceNowInstanceURL>
          <username>admin</username>
          <password>Diazo123@</password>
      </servicenow.init>
      <servicenow.postRecord>
          <tableName>incident</tableName>
          <sysparmDisplayValue>true</sysparmDisplayValue>
          <sysparmFields>short_description,number,sys_id</sysparmFields>
          <sysparmView>short_description,number,sys_id</sysparmView>
          <sysparmInputDisplayValue>true</sysparmInputDisplayValue>
          <number>34</number>
          <shortDescription>{$ctx:shortDescription}</shortDescription>
          <active>true</active>
          <approval>owner</approval>
          <category>inquiry</category>
          <contactType>{$ctx:contactType}</contactType>
      </servicenow.postRecord>
      <property expression="json-eval($.result.sys_id)" name="sysId" scope="default" type="STRING"/>
      </sequence>
    ```
3. Create the ReadRecord sequence as below. 
    ```xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <sequence name="ReadRecord" trace="disable" xmlns="http://ws.apache.org/ns/synapse">
        <servicenow.init>
            <serviceNowInstanceURL>https://dev55707.service-now.com</serviceNowInstanceURL>
            <username>admin</username>
            <password>Diazo123@</password>
        </servicenow.init>
        <servicenow.getRecordById>
            <sysId>{$ctx:sysId}</sysId>
            <tableName>incident</tableName>
        </servicenow.getRecordById>
    </sequence>
    ```
4. Now right click on the created Integration Project and select **New** -> **Rest API** to create the REST API. 
  
5. Provide the API name as ServiceNowAPI and the API context as `/servicenow`. You can go to the source view of the XML configuration file of the API and copy the following configuration. 
    ```xml
      <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
      <api context="/servicenow" name="ServiceNowAPI" xmlns="http://ws.apache.org/ns/synapse">
          <resource methods="POST" uri-template="/postRecord">
              <inSequence>
                  <property expression="json-eval($.shortDescription)" name="shortDescription" scope="default" type="STRING"/>
                  <property expression="json-eval($.contactType)" name="contactType" scope="default" type="STRING"/>
                  <sequence key="PostRecord"/>
                  <respond/>
              </inSequence>
              <outSequence/>
              <faultSequence/>
          </resource>
          <resource methods="POST" uri-template="/readRecord">
              <inSequence>
                <property expression="json-eval($.sysId)" name="sysId" scope="default" type="STRING"/>
                  <sequence key="ReadRecord"/>
                  <respond/>
              </inSequence>
              <outSequence/>
              <faultSequence/>
          </resource>
      </api>

    ```
