# ServiceNow Connector Overview

ServiceNow is an application platform as a service, which is a cloud-based computing model that provides the infrastructure needed to develop, run, and manage applications. It offers activities of an organization such as data collection, storage, workflow automation, and reporting through a single user interface. This software as a service (SaaS) platform contains a number of modular applications that can vary by instance and user. It focuses on service-orientation toward the tasks, activities, and processes.

The WSO2 ServiceNow connector allows you to access the ServiceNow REST API through WSO2 EI. Using ServiceNow connector you can work with Aggregate API, Import Set API and Table API in ServiceNow. You can further read about ServiceNow REST APIs from [here](https://developer.servicenow.com/dev.do#!/reference/api/orlando/rest/c_TableAPI).
