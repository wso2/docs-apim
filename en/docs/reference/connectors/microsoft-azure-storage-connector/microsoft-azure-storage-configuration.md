# Setting up the Microsoft Azure Storage Environment

To work with the Microsoft Azure Storage connector, you need to have a Microsoft Azure account. If you do not have a Microsoft Azure account, you are prompted to create one when you sign up.

## Signing Up for Microsoft Azure

To sign up for Microsoft Azure:

  1. Navigate to [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/free/)  and create a **Microsoft Azure account** using **Start free** button.
    
  2. Follow the online instructions.
    
Part of the sign-up procedure involves receiving a phone call and entering a verification code using the phone keypad. Microsoft Azure will notify you by email when your account is active and available for you to use.
