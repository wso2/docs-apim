# Amazon DynamoDB Connector Reference

The following operations allow you to work with the Amazon DynamoDB Connector. Click an operation name to see parameter details and samples on how to use it.

---

## Initialize the connector

To use the Amazon DynamoDB connector, add the <amazondynamodb.init> element in your configuration before carrying out any other operations. To authenticate, it uses the Signature Version 4 signing specification, which describes how to construct signed requests to AWS. Whenever you send a request to AWS, you must include authorization information with your request so that AWS can verify the authenticity of the request. AWS uses the authorization information from your request to recreate your signature and then compares that signature with the one that you sent. These two signatures must match for you to successfully access AWS. Click here for further reference on the signing process.

??? note "init"
    The init operation is used to initialize the connection to Amazon S3.

        <blocking>{$ctx:blocking}</blocking>
    </amazondynamodb.init>
    ```

    Ensure that the following Axis2 configurations are added and enabled in the `<PRODUCT_HOME>\conf\axis2\axis2.xml` file.

    ```xml
    <messageFormatter contentType="application/x-amz-json-1.0" class="org.apache.synapse.commons.json.JsonStreamFormatter"/>
    ...
    <messageBuilder contentType="application/x-amz-json-1.0" class="org.apache.synapse.commons.json.JsonStreamBuilder"/>
    ```

    > **Note**: If you want to perform blocking invocations, ensure that the above builder and formatter are added and enabled in the `<PRODUCT_HOME>\conf\axis2\axis2_blocking_client.xml` file.

### Items

??? note "batchGetItem"
    The batchGetItem operation returns the attributes of one or more items from one or more tables. The requested items are identified by the primary key. A single operation can retrieve up to 16 MB of data, which can contain as many as 100 items.

    The batchGetItem operation returns a partial result if the response size limit is exceeded, the table's provisioned throughput is exceeded, or an internal processing failure occurs. If a partial result is returned, the operation returns a value for UnprocessedKeys. You can use this value to retry the operation starting with the next item to get. For example, if you ask to retrieve 100 items, but each individual item is 300 KB in size, the system returns 52 items (so that the16 MB limit is not exceeded) and an appropriate UnprocessedKeys value, so that you can get the next page of results. If required, your application can include its own logic to assemble the pages of results into one dataset.

    If none of the items can be processed due to insufficient provisioned throughput on all of the tables in the request, batchGetItem will throw an exception. If at least one of the items is successfully processed, batchGetItem completes successfully while returning the keys of the unread items in UnprocessedKeys. By default, batchGetItem performs eventually consistent reads on every table in the request. If you want strongly consistent reads instead, you can set ConsistentRead to true for any or all tables. To minimize response latency, batchGetItem retrieves items in parallel. See the [related API documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_BatchGetItem.html) for more information.

        "UnprocessedKeys":{

    }
    ```

??? note "batchWriteItem"
    The batchWriteItem operation puts or deletes multiple items in one or more tables. A single call to batchWriteItem can write up to 16 MB of data, which can comprise as many as 25 put or delete requests. Individual items to be written can be as large as 400 KB. This operation cannot update items.

    The individual PutRequest and DeleteRequest operations specified in batchWriteItem are atomic, but batchWriteItem as a whole is not. If any requested operations fail because the table's provisioned throughput is exceeded or an internal processing failure occurs, the failed operations are returned in the UnprocessedItems response property. You can investigate and optionally resend the requests. Typically, you would call batchWriteItem in a loop. Each iteration would check for unprocessed items and submit a new batchWriteItem request with those unprocessed items until all items have been processed.

    Note that if none of the items can be processed due to insufficient provisioned throughput on all of the tables in the request, batchWriteItem will throw an exception. With batchWriteItem, you can efficiently write or delete large amounts of data, such as from Amazon Elastic MapReduce (EMR), or copy data from another database into DynamoDB. To improve performance with these large-scale operations, batchWriteItem does not behave in the same way as individual PutRequest and DeleteRequest calls would. For example, you cannot specify conditions on individual put and delete requests, and batchWriteItem does not return deleted items in the response.

    If one or more of the following is true, DynamoDB rejects the entire batch write operation:

    * One or more tables specified in the batchWriteItem request does not exist.
    * Primary key attributes specified on an item in the request do not match those in the corresponding table's primary key schema.
    * You try to perform multiple operations on the same item in the same batchWriteItem request. For example, you cannot put and delete the same item in the same batchWriteItem request.
    * There are more than 25 requests in the batch.
    * The total request size exceeds 16 MB.
    * Any individual item in a batch exceeds 400 KB.

??? note "deleteItem"
    The deleteItem operation deletes a single item in a table by primary key. You can perform a conditional delete operation that deletes the item if it exists, or if it has an expected attribute value. In addition to deleting an item, you can also return the item's attribute values in the same operation, using the returnValues property. Unless you specify conditions, deleteItem is an idempotent operation, and running it multiple times on the same item or attribute does not result in an error response. Conditional deletes are useful for only deleting items if specific conditions are met. If those conditions are met, DynamoDB performs the delete operation. Otherwise, the item is not deleted. 
    
    See the [related API documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteItem.html) for more information.

??? note "getItem"
    The getItem operation returns a set of attributes for the item with the given primary key. If there is no matching item, getItem does not return any data. This operation provides an eventually consistent read by default. If your application requires a strongly consistent read, set consistentRead to true. Although a strongly consistent read might take more time than an eventually consistent read, it always returns the last updated value.
    
    See the [related API documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_GetItem.html) for more information.

??? note "putItem"
    The putItem operation creates a new item, or replaces an old item with a new item. If an item already exists in the specified table with the same primary key, the new item completely replaces the existing item. You can perform a conditional put (insert a new item if one with the specified primary key does not exist), or replace an existing item if it has certain attribute values.

    In addition to creating an item, you can also return the attribute values of the item in the same operation using the returnValues property. When you add an item, the primary key attribute(s) are the only required attributes. Attribute values cannot be null. String and binary type attributes must have a length greater than zero. Set type attributes cannot be empty. Requests with empty values will be rejected with a validation exception. You can request that the putItem operation should return either a copy of the old item (before the update) or a copy of the new item (after the update).

    To prevent a new item from replacing an existing item, use a conditional expression with the putItem operation. The conditional expression should contain the attribute_not_exists function with the name of the attribute being used as the partition key for the table. Since every record must contain that attribute, the attribute_not_exists function will only succeed if no matching item exists. For more information about using this API, see Working with Items.
    
    See the [related API documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_PutItem.html) for more information.

??? note "query"
    The query operation uses the primary key of a table or a secondary index, to directly access items from that table or index. You can use the KeyConditionExpression property to provide a specific value for the partition key, and the query operation returns all of the items from the table or index with that partition key value. Optionally, you can narrow the scope of the query operation by specifying a sort key value and a comparison operator in KeyConditionExpression. You can use the ScanIndexForward property to get results in forward or reverse order, by sort key.

    Queries that do not return results consume the minimum read capacity units according to the type of read. If the total number of items meeting the query criteria exceeds the result set size limit of 1 MB, the query stops and results are returned to the user with a LastEvaluatedKey to continue the query in a subsequent operation. Unlike a scan operation, a query operation never returns an empty result set and a LastEvaluatedKey . The LastEvaluatedKey is only provided if the results exceed 1 MB, or if you have used limit.

    You can query a table, a local secondary index, or a global secondary index. For a query on a table or on a local secondary index, you can set consistentRead to true and obtain a strongly consistent result. Global secondary indexes support eventually consistent reads only, so do not specify consistentRead when querying a global secondary index.

??? note "scan"
    The scan operation returns one or more items and item attributes by accessing every item in the table. To have DynamoDB return fewer items, you can provide a scanFilter.

    If the total number of scanned items exceeds the maximum data set size limit of 1 MB, the scan stops and results are returned to the user with a LastEvaluatedKey to continue the scan in a subsequent operation. The results also include the number of items exceeding the limit. A scan can result in no table data meeting the filter criteria. The result set is eventually consistent.

    By default, scan operations proceed sequentially. For faster performance on large tables, applications can request a parallel scan by specifying the segment and totalSegments properties. For more information, see [Parallel Scan](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Query.html#QueryAndScanParallelScan).
    
    See the [related API documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_Query.html) for more information.

??? note "updateItem"
    The updateItem operation edits an existing item's attributes, or inserts a new item if it does not already exist. You can put, delete, or add attribute values. You can also perform a conditional update (insert a new attribute name-value pair if it doesn't exist, or replace an existing name-value pair if it has certain expected attribute values). In addition to updating an item, you can also return the item's attribute values in the same operation using the returnValues property.

### Tables

??? note "createTable"
    The createTable operation creates a new table. Table names must be unique within each region. See the [related API documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_CreateTable.html) for more information.

??? note "updateTable"
    The updateTable operation updates provisioned throughput settings, global secondary indexes, or DynamoDB Streams settings for a given table. You can only perform one of the following operations at a time:

    * Modify the provisioned throughput settings of the table.
    * Enable or disable streams on the table.
    * Remove a global secondary index from the table.
    * Create a new global secondary index on the table. Once the index begins backfilling, you can use updateTable to perform other operations. 
    
    See the [related API documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateTable.html) for more information.
