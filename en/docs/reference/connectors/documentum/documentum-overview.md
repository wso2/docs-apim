# Documentum Overview

Content, in a broad sense, is information stored as computer data files. It can include word processing, spreadsheet, graphics, video and audio files. Most content is stored locally on personal computers, organized arbitrarily, and only available to a single user. This means that valuable data is subject to loss, and projects are subject to delay when people cannot get the information they need.

The best way to protect these important assets is to move them to a centralized content management system. Documentum is one of the software that does all with the help of API calls. 

The Documentum Connector allows you to do the following operations.

* Create folder 
* Find folder
* Delete folder
* Create document 
* Find document
* Delete document 
* Create cabinets
* Find cabinet
* Delete cabinet 
* Get cabinet 
* Create acl 
* Apply acl 
* Delete acl
* Get all acls
* Get all version
* Get current version
* Delete all version action to be perform

To see the Documentum connector, navigate to the [connector store](https://store.wso2.com/store/assets/esbconnector/list) and search for "Documentum". **Documentum Connector** is the name of the connector that has this functionality.
