# Snowflake Connector Example

The Snowflake Connector allows you to access the [Snowflake JDBC Driver API](https://docs.snowflake.com/developer-guide/jdbc/jdbc) from an integration sequence. This provides functionalities to execute a set of standard Snowflake DDL, DML and query commands. You can use the connector to perform query, execute and batch execute operations on Snowflake databases. 

## What you'll build

This example demonstrates how to use the Snowflake Connector for querying, inserting, batch inserting and deleting data in a Snowflake database. Let's consider a use-case involving a hotel database for managing reservations. Within the hotel database, there exists a table named RESERVATIONS responsible for storing reservation details.

1. Insert a single record to the Snowflake database.
2. Insert multiple records to the Snowflake database.
3. Query data from the Snowflake database.
4. Delete data from the Snowflake database.

All operations are exposed via an API. The API with the context `/snowflakeconnector` has 5 resources.

* `/insertReservation` : Insert a single reservation to the Snowflake database.
* `/insertReservationBatch` : Insert a batch of reservations to the Snowflake database.
* `/getReservationInfo` : Retrieve all the reservations from the Snowflake database.
* `/deleteReservation` : Delete a reservation from the Snowflake database.

## Before you begin

Before you begin, you must have a valid Snowflake account. 
To use the Snowflake database, you must have a valid Snowflake account. To create a snowflake account, please visit the official Snowflake website and complete the registration process. Once registered you will obtain username and password which you can login to Snowflake account, and the account identifier which is the unique identifier for your Snowflake account within your business entity and the Snowflake network.

1. Create a database named `HOTEL_DB` in Snowflake.
2. Select the `PUBLIC` schema and create a table named `RESERVATIONS` with the following columns.

```sql
create table RESERVATIONS (
NICNUMBER String,
FIRSTNAME String,
LASTNAME String,
CHECKIN String,
CHECKOUT String,
ADULTS INT,
CHILDREN INT,
ROOMTYPE String,
SPECIALREQUESTS String
)
```

If you do not want to configure this yourself, you can simply [get the project](#get-the-project) and run it.

## Configure the connector in WSO2 Integration Studio

Connectors can be added to integration flows in [WSO2 Integration Studio](https://wso2.com/integration/integration-studio/). Once added, the operations of the connector can be dragged onto your canvas and added to your sequences.

### Import the connector

Follow these steps to set up the Integration Project and the Connector Exporter Project.

{!includes/reference/connectors/importing-connector-to-integration-studio.md!}

### Add integration logic

First create a REST API called `SnowflakeConnectorApi` in your project

| Name | Context |
| ---------------- | ---------------- |
| SnowflakeConnectorApi  | /snowflakeconnector  |

Create the following resources in 'SnowflakeConnectorApi' REST API

| uri-template                |
|-----------------------------| 
| /insertReservation          |
| /getReservationInfo         |
| /insertReservationBatch     |
| /deleteReservation          |

Let's add the operations to the resources in `SnowflakeConnectorApi` API

#### - /insertReservation

Users can utilize this resource to insert a single record into the snowflake database. The user will be sending the reservation payload in the request body.

1. In the API insequence drag and drop the [Property Mediator]({{base_path}}/reference/mediators/property-mediator/) to extract the payload from the request body. Let's store the payload in a property named `payload`.
    ```xml
      <property expression="json-eval($)" name="payload" scope="default" type="STRING"/>
   ```

   2. Drag and drop `execute` operation from **SnowflakeConnector** section.
      1. Double click the operation. It will show you the properties section.
      2. In the General Section of the properties, click on the `+` button next to `Snowflake Connection`
         <img src="{{base_path}}/assets/img/integrate/connectors/snowflake_connector/snowflake-connection-config.png" title="Connection Config function" width="800" alt="Snowflake Connection Config"/>
         1. In the `Connection Configurations` section give a name for `Snowflake Connection`
         2. Provide your Snowflake Account Identifier in the `Account Identifier` text box.
         3. Provide your Snowflake username in the `Username` text box.
         4. Provide your Snowflake password in the `Password` text box.
         5. Click finish.
      3. In the `Execute Query` text box, enter the following query.
         ```sql
         INSERT INTO HOTEL_DB.PUBLIC.RESERVATIONS (NICNUMBER, FIRSTNAME, LASTNAME, CHECKIN, CHECKOUT, ADULTS, CHILDREN, ROOMTYPE, SPECIALREQUESTS) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)
         ```
      4. For the `Payload` text box, enter `$ctx:payload` as an expression.
         <img src="{{base_path}}/assets/img/integrate/connectors/snowflake_connector/snowflake-execute-config.png" title="Execute Config" width="800" alt="Snowflake Execute Config"/>

         ```xml
         <snowflake.execute configKey="SNOWFLAKE_CONNECTION">
           <executeQuery>INSERT INTO HOTEL_DB.PUBLIC.RESERVATIONS (NICNUMBER, FIRSTNAME, LASTNAME, CHECKIN, CHECKOUT, ADULTS, CHILDREN, ROOMTYPE, SPECIALREQUESTS) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)</executeQuery>
           <payload>{$ctx:payload}</payload>
         </snowflake.execute>
         ```
3. Drag and drop the [Respond Mediator]({{base_path}}/reference/mediators/respond-mediator/) to send back the response.
   
#### - /getReservationInfo

Using this resource users retrieve all records from table `Reservations` of `HOTEL_DB`.

1. Drag and drop `query` operation from **SnowflakeConnector** section.
   1. Double-click the operation to view its properties section.
   2. In the 'General' section of the properties, select the Snowflake connection configuration you created.
   3. In the `Sql Query` text box, enter the following query.
      ```sql
      SELECT * FROM HOTEL_DB.PUBLIC.RESERVATIONS
      ```
      
      ```xml
      <snowflake.query configKey="SNOWFLAKE_CONNECTION">
         <query>SELECT * FROM HOTEL_DB.PUBLIC.RESERVATIONS</query>
      </snowflake.query>
      ```
      
2. Drag and drop the [Property Mediator]({{base_path}}/reference/mediators/property-mediator/) and set the Property name as 'messageType' and the value as application/json. This is added so that the response will be in json.
   ```xml
    <property name="messageType" scope="axis2" type="STRING" value="application/json"/>
   ```
3. Drag and drop the [Respond Mediator]({{base_path}}/reference/mediators/respond-mediator/) to send back the response.

#### - /insertReservationBatch

Using this resource users can insert multiple records into table `Reservations` of `HOTEL_DB`. The user will be sending the bulk payload in the request body.

1. In the API insequence drag and drop the [Property Mediator]({{base_path}}/reference/mediators/property-mediator/) to extract the payload from the request body. Let's store the payload in a property called `payload`.
    ```xml
      <property expression="json-eval($)" name="payload" scope="default" type="STRING"/>
    ```
2. Drag and drop `batchExecute` operation from **SnowflakeConnector** section.

      ```
   4. For the `Payload` text box, enter `$ctx:payload` as an expression.

      ```xml
      <snowflake.batchExecute configKey="SNOWFLAKE_CONNECTION">
         <executeQuery>INSERT INTO HOTEL_DB.PUBLIC.RESERVATIONS (NICNUMBER, FIRSTNAME, LASTNAME, CHECKIN, CHECKOUT, ADULTS, CHILDREN, ROOMTYPE, SPECIALREQUESTS) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)</executeQuery>
         <payload>{$ctx:payload}</payload>
      </snowflake.batchExecute>
      ```
   5. Drag and drop the [Respond Mediator]({{base_path}}/reference/mediators/respond-mediator/) to send back the response.

### Testing the resources

Let's test the API. Deploy the carbon application and start the Micro Integrator.

1. Insert Reservation Resource
    1. Create a file called payload.json with the following payload.
        ```json
        {
            "NICNUMBER": "9876543210",
            "FIRSTNAME": "Alice",
            "LASTNAME": "Johnson",
