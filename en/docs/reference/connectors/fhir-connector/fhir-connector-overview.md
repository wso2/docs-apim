# FHIR Connector Overview

Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) is an interoperability standard for electronic exchange of healthcare information. The FHIR connector can be used to invoke FHIR operations within the mediation logic. 

This connector uses the [HAPI FHIR APIs](https://hapifhir.io) to connect with a Test Server, which is an open source server licensed under the Apache Software License 2.0 (Java-based implementation of the FHIR specification).

To see the FHIR Connector, navigate to the [connector store](https://store.wso2.com/store/assets/esbconnector/list) and search for "fhir".
