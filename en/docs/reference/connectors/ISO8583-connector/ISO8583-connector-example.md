# ISO8583 Connector Example

Given below is a sample scenario that demonstrates how the WSO2 ISO8583 Connector sends an ISO8583 message to financial networks using the integration runtime of WSO2.

## What you'll build

This example demonstrates how to expose core banking system functionality working with ISO8583 protocol as an API. Here, the integration runtime acts as ISO8583 terminal for the banking network. In this scenario to mock the banking network we used Test mock server.

Given below is a sample API that illustrates how you can configure ISO8583 with the `init` operation and then use the `iso8583.sendMessage` operation to send an ISO8583 message for the financial transactions.

To know the further information about the  `init` and `iso8583.sendMessage` operations please refer this link.

If you do not want to configure this yourself, you can simply [get the project](#get-the-project) and run it.

## Configure the connector in WSO2 Integration Studio

Follow these steps to set up the Integration Project and the Connector Exporter Project.

{!reference/connectors/importing-connector-to-integration-studio.md!}

1. Right click on the created Integration Project and select, -> **New** -> **Rest API** to create the REST API.

2. Specify the API name as `SendisoTestAPI` and API context as `/sendiso`. You can go to the source view of the XML configuration file of the API and copy the following configuration (source view).

   ```
   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <api context="/sendiso" name="SendisoTestAPI" xmlns="http://ws.apache.org/ns/synapse">
       <resource methods="POST">
           <inSequence>
               <log>
                   <property name="status" value="Sending_an_ISO8583_Messsage"/>
               </log>
               <iso8583.init>
                   <serverHost>localhost</serverHost>
                   <serverPort>5010</serverPort>
               </iso8583.init>
               <iso8583.sendMessage/>
               <respond/>
           </inSequence>
           <outSequence>
               <log/>
               <send/>
           </outSequence>
           <faultSequence/>
       </resource>
   </api>
   ```
Now we can export the imported connector and the API into a single CAR application. CAR application is the one we are going to deploy to server runtime.

## Deployment

Follow these steps to deploy the exported CApp in the integration runtime.

## Testing

Invoke the API as shown below using the curl command. Curl Application can be downloaded from [here](https://curl.haxx.se/download.html).
      
   ```
          curl -v POST -d 
          '<ISOMessage>
               <header>AAAAaw==</header>
               <data>
                <field id="104">000001161204171926FABCDE123ABD06414243</field>

               </data>
           </ISOMessage>' "http://localhost:8290/sendiso" -H "Content-Type:application/xml"
   ```        
**Expected Response**:
   
   ```
          <ISOMessage>
          <header>MDIxMA==</header>
          <data>
          <field id="0">8000</field>
          <field id="23">000</field>
          </data>
          </ISOMessage>  
   ```                           
## What's next

* You can deploy and run your project on Docker or Kubernetes. See the instructions in [Running the Micro Integrator on Containers]({{base_path}}/install-and-setup/installation/run_in_containers).
