# Amazon SQS Connector Overview

Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) is a fully managed message queuing service that allows you to run business applications and services so that the messaging is not dependent on the IT infrastructure itself. This means the messages can run and fail independently of each other in a way that does not cause slowdowns, system-wide faults, or a disturbance within the application. By using Amazon SQS, you can move data between distributed components of your applications that perform different tasks without losing messages or requiring each component to be always available.

To see the Amazon SQS connector, navigate to the [connector store](https://store.wso2.com/store/assets/esbconnector/list) and search for "Amazon".
