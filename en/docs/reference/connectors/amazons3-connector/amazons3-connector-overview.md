# Amazon S3 Connector Overview

Amazon S3 is a web-based storage service that can be used to store and retrieve data at anytime from anywhere on the web. Amazon uses the same service to run its own network that proves its scalability, reliability, and security.

The Amazon S3 Connector versions 1.0.10 and below allow you to access the REST API of [Amazon Storage Service S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/Welcome.html). This lets you store your information and retrieve it back when needed. The AmazonS3 Connector is useful to take your on-premise data to the cloud. The advantage is, you do not need to worry about managing and replicating data on-premise.

The versions 2.0.0 and above allow you to access the AWS component via AWS [SDK](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/). The SDK makes it easy to call AWS services using idiomatic Java APIs.

To see the Amazon S3 connector, navigate to the [connector store](https://store.wso2.com/store/assets/esbconnector/list) and search for "Amazon".
