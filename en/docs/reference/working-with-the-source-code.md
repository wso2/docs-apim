# Working with the Source Code

The source code of all WSO2 products as well as the scripts that are used for building WSO2 products are maintained in GitHub repositories. If you are a developer, you can easily clone the source code from these Git repositories, and if required, you can do modifications and build a customized product on your own. For more information, see the following:
