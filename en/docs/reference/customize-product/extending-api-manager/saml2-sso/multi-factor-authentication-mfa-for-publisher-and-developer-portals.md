# Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) for Publisher and Developer Portals

Multi-factor authentication provided many-layers of security for a user's identity, where even if one factor is compromised, an attacker cannot gain full access to the target due to the remaining authentication factors.

Follow the steps below to configure MFA for the Publisher and Developer Portal with WSO2 Identity Server (WSO2 IS):

1.  Configure Single Sign-On (SSO) with WSO2 Identity Server. 

     For more information, see [Configuring Identity Server as IDP for SSO]({{base_path}}/develop/extending-api-manager/saml2-sso/configuring-identity-server-as-idp-for-sso).

2.  Configure Multi-factor Authentication in WSO2 Identity Server. 

     For more information, see [Configuring Multi-factor Authentication for WSO2 IS](https://is.docs.wso2.com/en/5.10.0/learn/multi-factor-authentication).
