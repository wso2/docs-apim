# Configuring reCaptcha for Self Sign-up

Self Sign-up is an important feature when it comes to commercial
applications. This feature gives the users the privilege of being a
part of your community without you having to go through the hassle of
adding them.

This topic guides you through configuring reCaptcha for the self
registration flow. By configuring reCaptcha, you can mitigate or block
brute force attacks.
