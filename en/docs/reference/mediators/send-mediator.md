# Send Mediator

The **Send Mediator** is used to send messages out of Synapse to an endpoint. The Send Mediator also copies any message context properties from the current message context to the reply message received on the execution of the send operation, so that the response could be correlated back to the request. Messages may be correlated by WS-A MessageID, or even simple custom text labels.

!!! Info
    - The Send mediator is a [content-unaware]({{base_path}}/reference/mediators/about-mediators/#classification-of-mediators) mediator.
    - A send operation can be blocking or non-blocking depending on the actual transport implementation used. The default NIO-based http/s implementation does not block on a send. Therefore, if a message should be sent and further processed (e.g. transformed) afterwards, it is required to clone the message into two copies and then perform the processing to avoid conflicts.
    - Do not add any mediator configurations after Send mediator in the same sequence, because the Micro Integrator does not process them. Any mediator configuration after the Send mediator should go to the outSequence orÂ receive sequence.

## Syntax

``` java
<send/>
```

If the message is to be sent to one or more endpoints, use the following syntax:

``` java
<send>
   (endpointref | endpoint)+
</send>
```

-   The `          endpointref         ` token refers to the following:
    ``` java
    <endpoint key="name"/>
    ```
-   The `          endpoint         ` token refers to an anonymous endpoint definition.

## Examples

### Send mediator used in the In sequence and Out sequence

In this example, the first send operation is included in the In
mediator. Both the request and response will go through the main
sequence, but only request messages will go through the In mediator.
Similarly, only response messages will go through the Out mediator. The
request will be forwarded to the endpoint with the given address. The
response will go through the second send operation, which in this
example just sends it back to the client because there is no Out
endpoint specified.

``` java
<proxy name="SimpleProxy" transports="http https" startonload="true" trace="disable" xmlns="http://ws.apache.org/ns/synapse">
    <target>
         <inSequence>
        <send>
            <endpoint>
                <address uri="http://localhost:9000/services/SimpleStockQuoteService"/>
            </endpoint>
        </send>
    </inSequence>
    <outSequence>
        <send/>
    </outSequence>
    </target>
</proxy>
```

### Specifying a response handling sequence (service chaining) 

```
<send receive="personInfoSeq">
    <endpoint key="PersonInfoEpr"/>
</send>
```

In this example, requests are sent to the
`         PersonInfoEpr        ` endpoint, and responses from the
service at that endpoint are handled by a sequence named personInfoSeq.
This approach is particularly useful for service chaining. For example,
if you want to take the responses from the
`         PersonInfoEpr        ` service and send them to the
`         CreditEpr        ` service for additional processing before
sending the final response back to the client. In this case, you can
configure the `         personInfoSeq        ` sequence to send the
response to the `         CreditEpr        ` service and also specify
another receive sequence named `         creditSeq        ` that sends
the response from the `         CreditEpr        ` service back to the
client. Following is the configuration of these sequences.

```
<sequence name="personInfoSeq">
    <xslt key="xslt">
        <property name="amount" expression="get-property('ORG_AMOUNT')"/>
    </xslt>
    <send receive="creditSeq">
        <endpoint key="CreditEpr"/>
    </send>
</sequence>

<sequence name="creditSeq">
    <log level="full"/>
    <send/>
</sequence>
```

### Configuring a blocking/non-blocking send operation

In this example, the Send mediator in a proxy service using the [VFS
transport]({{base_path}}/install-and-setup/setup/mi-setup/transport_configurations/configuring-transports/#configuring-the-vfs-transport) is
transferring a file to a VFS endpoint. VFS is a non-blocking transport
by default, which means a new thread is spawned for each outgoing
message. The [Property mediator](_Property_Mediator_) added before the
Send mediator removes the [ClientAPINonBlocking](_Generic_Properties_)
property from the message to perform the mediation in a single thread.
This is required when the file being transferred is large and you want
to avoid out-of-memory failures.

```
<inSequence>
   <property name="ClientApiNonBlocking"
           value="true"
           scope="axis2"
           action="remove"/>
   <send>
      <endpoint name="FileEpr">
         <address uri="vfs:file:////home/shammi/file-out"/>
      </endpoint>
   </send>
</inSequence>
```
