# Sequence Mediator

The **Sequence Mediator** refers to an already defined sequence element,
which is used to invoke a named sequence of mediators. This is useful
when you need to use a particular set on mediators in a given order
repeatedly.

You can alternatively select a pre-defined sequence from the RegistryÂ as
the in/out/fault sequence for a proxy service or a REST service without
adding any mediator configurations inline. The difference between these
two options are described in the table below.

| Attribute                                         | Picking a pre-defined sequence as in/out/fault sequence                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Referring to a pre-defined sequence via the Sequence mediator                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

!!! Info
    The Sequence mediator is a [content-unaware]({{base_path}}/reference/mediators/about-mediators/#classification-of-mediators) mediator.

## Syntax

A sequence ref token refers to a \< `         sequence        ` \>
element, which is used to invoke a named sequence of mediators.

``` java
<sequence key="name"/>
```

## Configuration

The parameters available to configure the Sequence mediator are as follows.

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 50%" />
<col style="width: 50%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Parameter Name</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Key Type</strong></td>
<td><p>This parameter defines whether the key to access the required sequence is a static key or a dynamic key. Possible values are as follows.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Static Key</strong>: If this is selected, the key to access the sequence is a static value. You can click either <strong>Configuration Registry</strong> or <strong>Governance Registry</strong> as relevant to select the require key from the resource tree for the <strong>Referring Sequence</strong> parameter.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic Key</strong>: If this is selected, you can define the key to access the sequence as a dynamic value by entering an XPath expression in the <strong>Referring Sequence</strong> parameter.</li>
</ul></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Referring sequence</strong></td>
<td><div class="content-wrapper">
<p>The key to access the sequence saved in the registry. You can enter a static value selected from the resource tree, or an XPath expression based on the option you selected for the <strong>Key Type</strong> parameter.</p>
<b>Tip</b>:
<p>You can click <strong>NameSpaces</strong> to add namespaces if you are providing an expression. Then the <strong>Namespace Editor</strong> panel would appear where you can provide any number of namespace prefixes and URLs used in the XPath expression.</p>
</div></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

## Examples

In this example, the following sequence named `         StoreSend        ` is saved in the Configuration registry. It includes a [Store Mediator]({{base_path}}/reference/mediators/store-Mediator) to store the request in a message store named `         JMSMS        ` and a [Send Mediator]({{base_path}}/reference/mediators/send-Mediator) to send it to an endpoint afterwards.

``` xml
<sequence xmlns="http://ws.apache.org/ns/synapse" name="conf:/StoreSend">
   <axis2ns4:store xmlns:axis2ns4="http://ws.apache.org/ns/synapse" messageStore="JMSMS" sequence="conf:/repository/components/org.wso2.carbon.throttle/templates"></axis2ns4:store>
   <send>
      <endpoint>
         <address uri="http://localhost:9000/services/SimpleStockQuoteService"></address>
      </endpoint>
   </send>
</sequence>
```

The Sequence mediator configuration can be as follows to invoke the `StoreSend` sequence after using a [PayloadFactory mediator]({{base_path}}/reference/mediators/payloadFactory-Mediator) to transform the contents of the request.

``` 
<inSequence xmlns="http://ws.apache.org/ns/synapse">
    <payloadFactory media-type="xml">
      <format>
           <m:checkpriceresponse xmlns:m="http://services.samples/xsd">
               <m:code>$1</m:code>
               <m:price>$2</m:price>
           </m:checkpriceresponse>
      </format>
      <args>
           <arg expression="//m0:symbol" xmlns:m0="http://services.samples/xsd">
           <arg expression="//m0:last" xmlns:m0="http://services.samples/xsd">
      </arg></arg></args>
    </payloadFactory>
    <sequence key="conf:/StoreSend"></sequence>
</inSequence>
```
