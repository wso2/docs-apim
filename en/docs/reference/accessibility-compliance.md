# Accessibility Compliance

According to WHO over 2 billion people, about 37.5% of the world's population, have some form of disability. 
1.3 billion people, about 17% of the world's population, are affected by some form of [blindness and visual impairment](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/blindness-and-visual-impairment). When considering the people with “temporary disabilities” and “situational limitations”, users that require accessibility support are significantly high.

Many countries have imposed laws to enforce accessibility support in web presence. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Final Standards and Guidelines (2017) update the existing Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and Section 255 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, to comply with [WCAG 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) Level AA. European Accessibility Act of 2019 requires that products and services comply with [WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) Level AA as the minimum standard.

We at WSO2 are committed to deliver accessible products and build inclusive designs. The **WSO2 APIM 4.0.0 Developer Portal** complies with Level A and Level AA Success Criteria and techniques of the **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1** ([WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?showtechniques=111%2C123%2C141%2C143%2C144%2C146%2C1412%2C1413%2C211%2C231%2C243%2C244%2C245%2C246%2C247%2C248%2C249%2C2410%2C251%2C252%2C253%2C254%2C311%2C316%2C321%2C322%2C323%2C324%2C325%2C331%2C332%2C411%2C412%2C1411&currentsidebar=%23col_overview&levels=aaa&technologies=smil%2Cpdf%2Cflash%2Csl)).

This will make content more accessible to a broader range of people with disabilities and more usable to users in general. With this all functionality of the Developer Portal, it is now operable through a keyboard interface. Color is not used as the only visual means of conveying information anymore. Content is now robust and understandable making it more user-friendly and easy to use.
