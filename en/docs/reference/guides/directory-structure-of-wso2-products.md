# Directory Structure of WSO2 Products

All WSO2 products are built on top of the Carbon platform. The directory structure described below is the structure that is inherited by all Carbon-based WSO2 products. However, note that each product may contain folders and files that are specific to the product, in addition to what is described below.

!!! tip
    `<PRODUCT_HOME>` refers to the root folder of the WSO2 product distribution. `<PROFILE_HOME>` refers to the root directory of other profiles that are shipped as separate runtimes with a product.
