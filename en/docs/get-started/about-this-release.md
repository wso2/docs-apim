# About this Release

The WSO2 API Manager is a platform for building and managing APIs. It helps developers implement APIs by integrating different types of systems and APIs and to manage them using its API governance and lifecycle management capabilities. APIs could be built by integrating different types of APIs such as traditional request-response style APIs and event-driven APIs using a low-code/no-code development experience and expose to consumers through its API Gateway. 

For more information on WSO2 API Manager, see the [overview in the WSO2 API Manager 4.0.0 documentation]({{base_path}}/getting-started/overview/).

The **WSO2 API Manager 4.0.0** is the **latest** **WSO2 API Manager release** and is the successor of **WSO2 API Manager 3.2.0** and **WSO2 Enterprise Integrator 7.1.0**. It contains the following components, which have new features and enhancements:

---

## API Manager 

The API Manager component addresses all aspects of API management in the platform. It consists of an API Gateway, API Publisher, Developer Portal, Key Manager and Traffic Manager.

It is now available to download from [here](https://github.com/wso2/product-apim/releases/).

#### New features

- **[New Service Catalog that lists registered services]({{base_path}}/integrate/develop/working-with-service-catalog/)**
    WSO2 API Manager includes a Service Catalog where developers can register their services in a RESTful manner. Service Catalog is one of the main attributes that enable the API-first Integration in WSO2 API Manager. Through the Service Catalog, integration services are made discoverable to the API Management layer so that API proxies can directly be created using them.

- **[API and API Product Revision Support]({{base_path}}/design/create-api/create-api-revisions/)**
    If you are an API Publisher, there can be a situation where you need to keep track of the different deployments of your API. For this purpose, a new concept named **Revisions** has been introduced. The revisions of your API can be **deployed** to specific Gateway Environment(s) as needed. These revisions cannot be edited and you can even **restore** your API to a specific revision if you want to discard the latest changes.

- **[Swagger/GraphqL to Postman Collection]({{base_path}}/consume/invoke-apis/invoke-apis-using-tools/invoke-an-graphql-api-using-the-integrated-graphql-console/)**
    [GraphQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql) is the graphical, interactive, web-based GraphQL integrated development environment (IDE) for GraphQL query and it has a reference implementation from the GraphQL Foundation. If required, instead of using the integrated GraphQL console you can try out your GraphQL API by downloading your GraphQL Schema as a Postman collection and trying it out on Postman. For more information, see [Try out using Postman]({{base_path}}/consume/invoke-apis/invoke-apis-using-tools/try-out-using-postman.md).

- **[Support for Forgerock Key Manager]({{base_path}}/administer/key-managers/configure-forgerock-connector/)** 
    WSO2 API Manager can connect to ForgeRock out-of-the-box using the [WSO2 API-M ForgeRock Connector](https://github.com/wso2-extensions/apim-km-forgerock). WSO2 API Manager has the capability to support multiple Key Managers at the same time. So with the use of connectors, it is capable of supporting any authorization server as a Key Manager, and in this case, it supports a connection to Forgerock as a third-party Key Manager.

- **[Support for Ping Key Manager]({{base_path}}/administer/key-managers/configure-pingfederate-connector/)** 
    WSO2 API Manager supports multiple Key Managers at the same time. As a result, WSO2 API Manager is prepacked with an inbuilt resident Key Manager, and with the use of connectors, it is capable of supporting any authorization server as a Key Manager. WSO2 API Manager can connect PingFederate out-of-the-box using the [WSO2 API-M PingFederate Connector](https://github.com/wso2-extensions/apim-km-pingfederate).

- **[Support for auth0 Key Manager]({{base_path}}/administer/key-managers/configure-auth0-connector/)** 
    It is possible to integrate the WSO2 API Manager with an external Identity and Access Management server (IAM) using the Auth0 OAuth Authorization Server to manage the OAuth clients and tokens that are required by WSO2 API Manager. WSO2 API Manager has inbuilt support to consume APIs exposed by Auth0 OAuth.

- **[Streaming API support in API Gateway]({{base_path}}/design/create-api/create-streaming-api/streaming-api-overview)**
    Streaming APIs are asynchronous APIs that support asynchronous message flows. Asynchronous message flows are popular in the event driven architecture. With Streaming APIs, you can expose and manage **WebSocket**, **WebSub (Webhook)** and **Server Sent Events (SSE)** backends in WSO2 API Manager.

- **[AsyncAPI Definitions for Streaming APIs]({{base_path}}/design/create-api/create-a-streaming-api-from-an-asyncapi-definition)**
    [AsyncAPI](https://www.asyncapi.com/) is used to define asynchronous APIs. In WSO2 API Manager, [Streaming APIs]({{base_path}}/design/create-api/create-streaming-api/streaming-api-overview) can be created by importing AsyncAPI definitions, and existing Streaming APIs can be exported as AsyncAPI definitions.

- **[Exposing APIs via Custom Hostnames (Virtual Hosts)]({{base_path}}/deploy-and-publish/deploy-on-gateway/deploy-api/exposing-apis-via-custom-hostnames)**
    **Virtual Host** enables you to deploy an API or API Product Revision to a Gateway with a custom hostname. Gateway environments and its virtual hosts can be managed via Admin Portal, and the API Publisher can choose a host when deploying an API Revision or API Product Revision. 

<!--

- Changes to Publisher API/UI to support Streaming APIs

- Changes to Dev Portal REST API/UI to support Streaming APIs

- Improved Commenting Feature (Nested commenting, publisher view)

- Defaulting code and configs to do with event based
-->

#### Removed features and functionalities

- Microgateway Labels

      [Grouping APIs with Microgateway Labels](https://apim.docs.wso2.com/en/3.2.0/learn/api-microgateway/grouping-apis-with-labels/)
      is removed from this release. Instead, you can use [Virtual Hosts (VHosts)]({{base_path}}/deploy-and-publish/deploy-on-gateway/deploy-api/exposing-apis-via-custom-hostnames)
      and dynamically manageable Gateway environments to group and expose APIs with custom hostnames.

#### Key changes

- The name of the startup script has changed from `wso2server.sh` (Linux/Mac OS) and `wso2server.bat` (Windows) to `api-manager.sh` and `api-manager.bat` respectively. Refer the [documentation on running the product]({{base_path}}/install-and-setup/install/running-the-product/) for instructions.

---

## Micro Integrator

The Micro Integrator is a cloud-native, standards-based messaging engine and an integration framework with a configuration based runtime environment for integrating APIs, services, data, SaaS, proprietary, and legacy systems. This is a newly added component to API Manager 4.

This serves the integration needs for the data plane of the API Manager platform.

It is now available to download from [here](https://github.com/wso2/micro-integrator/releases/).

#### New features

- **[New and improved File Connector]({{base_path}}/reference/connectors/file-connector/file-connector-overview/)**
    The File Connector allows you to connect to different file systems and perform various operations. The File Connector uses the [Apache Commons VFS](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-vfs/) I/O functionalities to execute operations. For more information, see **[File Connector Example]({{base_path}}/reference/connectors/file-connector/file-connector-example/)** and **[File Connector Reference]({{base_path}}/reference/connectors/file-connector/file-connector-config/)**.

- **[Hashicorp Secure Vault]({{base_path}}/install-and-setup/setup/mi-setup/security/using-hashicorp-secrets/)**
    By default, the Micro Integrator is configured to use WSO2 secure vault for encrypting secrets. However, you may encounter certain limitations with WSO2 secure vault if you use secrets with a large number of characters. You can overcome this issue by using HashiCorp secrets.

- **[JSON evaluation support for property mediator]({{base_path}}/reference/mediators/property-mediator/)**
    Enhanced JSON evaluation support was added for the property mediator.

- **[FreeMarker support PayloadFactory mediator]({{base_path}}reference/mediators/payloadfactory-mediator/)**
    You can now use the **FreeMarker** template to write the payload. This is particularly useful when defining complex JSON payloads.

- **[OAuth endpoint](reference/synapse-properties/endpoint-properties/)**
    A message exit point or an endpoint defines an external destination for a message. Typically, this is the address of a proxy service that acts as the front end to the actual service. You can configure the endpoint artifacts with any attributes or semantics needed for communicating with that service. An endpoint could represent a URL, a mailbox, a JMS queue, a TCP socket, etc. along with the settings needed for the connection.

- **[Call mediator improvement]({{base_path}}/reference/mediators/call-mediator/)**
    Improvements have been made to the call mediator so that it can now store the response to a property.

- **[Generating service catalog entry (open API definition)]({{base_path}}/integrate/develop/working-with-service-catalog/)**
    WSO2 API Manager includes a Service Catalog where developers can register their services in a RESTful manner. Integration services can be created when deploying your project as a C-App. These integration services are made discoverable to the API Management layer via the Service Catalog so that API proxies can directly be created using them.
