## New features

#### API Governance

??? note "Management of real-time APIs on Solace"

    WSO2 API Manager 4.1.0 now supports integrating external third-party Gateways and Brokers. Solace is an advanced event broker that is efficiently streaming events and information across cloud, on-premises, and IoT environments.

    **[Learn more]({{base_path}}/tutorials/integrating-with-solace/)**

??? note "Develop an integration from a managed API"

    With the API Manager 4.1.0 release, you can create an integration using a managed API and configure the integration service endpoint to the managed API. This is the top-down approach in API first integration.

    **[Learn more]({{base_path}}/tutorials/develop-an-integration-with-a-managed-api/)**

??? note "Publishing third-party APIs on the Developer Portal"

    WSO2 API Manager provides the capability to publish APIs that are deployed in an external Gateway. Since these APIs are not deployed in the WSO2 API Gateway, the API will not be proxied through the Gateway.

    **[Learn more]({{base_path}}/deploy-and-publish/publish-on-dev-portal/third-party-api-support/)**

??? note "A read-only mode for API Publisher"

    This feature allows a user who has view/read-only permissions to only view the API, API Product, and Service details in the Publisher portal. This user can also review all the analytics-related details.

    **[Learn more]({{base_path}}/design/api-security/authorization/publisher-portal-in-read-only-mode/)**

??? note "Mock API implementation support considering API definition in Choreo Connect"

    This Mock API Implementation allows you to generate mock responses based on the examples provided in the OpenAPI specification that will mock the API responses.

    **[Learn more]({{base_path}}/deploy-and-publish/deploy-on-gateway/choreo-connect/deploy-api/deploy-rest-api-with-mock-impl/)**

#### API Security

??? note "API consumer authorization with Open Policy Agent (OPA)"

    You can now offload some of the decision-making responsibilities to OPA on whether to authorize a consumer or not when they invoke APIs based on policies attached to APIs.

    **[Learn more]({{base_path}}/design/api-security/opa-validation/overview/)**

??? note "Authentication support for API invocation using the Token Exchange approach"

    You can now get an API Manager token by invoking the token endpoint of API Manager with the required parameters (i.e., the token obtained from an external Identity Provider) and invoking the API with the exchanged token.

    **[Learn more]({{base_path}}/administer/key-managers/configure-custom-connector/)**

#### API Policies

??? note "Operation level policy support for APIs"

    With the API Manager 4.1.0 release, we introduce fine-grained and easy to manage policies for operations. We move away from the concept of attaching a policy at the API level (i.e., API level mediation policies) and now can attach multiple policies at the operation level itself.

    **[Learn more]({{base_path}}/design/api-policies/overview/)**

#### Integration

??? note "WSDL to REST conversion support in Integration Studio"

    With API Manager 4.1.0, you now have a hybrid environment where some system APIs exist as SOAP-based web services that can also have a REST interface defined.

    **[Learn more]({{base_path}}/integrate/develop/creating-artifacts/creating-an-api/)**

??? note "Exposing an integration SOAP service as a managed API"

    WSO2 API Manager includes a Service Catalog where developers can register their backend services as Managed APIs. Through the Service Catalog, now SOAP integration services are made discoverable to the API Management layer so that SOAP PassThrough API proxies can directly be created using them.

    **[Learn more]({{base_path}}/tutorials/integration-tutorials/service-catalog-tutorial-for-proxy-services/)**

??? note "Authorization support via secondary user stores in Micro Integrator"

    Users can now deploy secondary user stores in Micro Integrator and use those users and roles in authorization use cases.

    **[Learn more]({{base_path}}/administer/managing-users-and-roles/managing-user-stores/configuring-secondary-user-stores-mi/#configuring-secondary-user-stores)**

??? note "Auto-generation support for data services using a given data source in Integration Studio"

    This feature allows you to generate data service definitions by pointing to an existing data source in the workspace without creating it from scratch.

    **[Learn more]({{base_path}}/integrate/develop/creating-artifacts/data-services/creating-data-services/#generate-data-service-from-a-datasource)**

#### Event Driven Architecture

??? note "Support for GraphQL subscription operations"

    WSO2 API Manager 4.1.0 supports GraphQL subscription operations, which extends GraphQL APIs for push-based solutions. In GraphQL subscriptions, clients send long-lasting GraphQL read operations and get updated results whenever a particular server-side event occurs. Commonly, updated results are pushed from the server to the subscribing clients via WebSockets, where the server holds a steady connection with the client.

    **[Learn more]({{base_path}}/tutorials/create-and-publish-a-graphql-api/#5.2)**

#### API Analytics

??? note "Publishing analytics events to external systems"

    Instead of publishing analytics events to the cloud, it is now possible to log the same events and publish them to external systems like ELK. You can create a sample, configure the created sample with API Manager or Choreo Connect, and publish it to the external system.

    **[Learn more]({{base_path}}/api-analytics/samples/publishing-analytics-events-to-external-systems/)**

#### Monitoring

??? note "Logging messages per API"

    WSO2 API Manager 4.1.0 enables a simple way to observe requests and responses going through the WSO2 API Gateway by introducing this lightweight feature called API Logs.

    **[Learn more]({{base_path}}/observe/api-manager/monitoring-api-logs/)**

??? note "Maintaining audit logs for the Micro Integrator Management API"

    The audit log capability allows you to add logging for the Micro Integrator Management API. Maintaining audit logs allows you to identify the changes that took place in the Micro Integrator instance and also to identify who made those changes.

    **[Learn more]({{base_path}}/observe/micro-integrator/classic-observability-logs/monitoring-mi-audit-logs/)**
