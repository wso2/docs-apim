# About this Release

WSO2 API Manager is a complete platform for building, integrating, and exposing your digital services as managed APIs in the cloud, on-premise, and hybrid architectures to drive your digital transformation strategy. It allows API developers to design, publish, and manage the lifecycle of APIs and API product managers to create API products from one or more APIs. APIs can be built by integrating different types of APIs such as traditional request-response style APIs and Event-driven APIs using a low-code/no-code development experience, and the APIs can be exposed to consumers through its API Gateway. 

For more information on WSO2 API Manager, see the [overview]({{base_path}}/getting-started/overview/).

The **WSO2 API Manager 4.0.0** is the latest **WSO2 API Manager release** and is the successor of **WSO2 API Manager 3.2.0** and **WSO2 Enterprise Integrator 7.1.0**. It contains the following components, which have new features and enhancements:

## **API Manager**

The API Manager component addresses all aspects of API management in the platform. It consists of an API Gateway, API Publisher, Developer Portal, Key Manager, and Traffic Manager.

It is now available to download from [here](https://wso2.com/api-management/#).

### New features

- **[New Service Catalog that lists registered services]({{base_path}}/design/create-api/create-an-api-using-a-service/)**
    
	 WSO2 API Manager includes a Service Catalog where developers can register their services in a RESTful manner. Service Catalog is one of the main attributes that enable the API-first Integration in WSO2 API Manager. Through the Service Catalog, integration services are made discoverable to the API Management layer so that API proxies can directly be created using them.

- **[API and API Product revision support]({{base_path}}/design/create-api/create-api-revisions/)**
    
	 If you are an API Publisher, there can be a situation where you need to keep track of the different deployments of your API. For this purpose, a new concept named **Revisions** has been introduced. The revisions of your API can be **deployed** to specific Gateway Environment(s) as needed. You cannot edit the revisions. However, if required, you can **restore** your API to a specific revision if you want to discard the latest changes.

- **[OpenAPI or GraphQL to Postman Collection]({{base_path}}/consume/invoke-apis/invoke-apis-using-tools/invoke-an-graphql-api-using-the-integrated-graphql-console/)**

    If required, instead of using the integrated GraphQL console or the integrated API Console, you can try out your GraphQL API and REST API respectively by downloading a Postman collection for your API and trying it out on Postman. For more information, see [Try out using Postman]({{base_path}}/consume/invoke-apis/invoke-apis-using-tools/try-out-using-postman/).

- **[Support for ForgeRock Key Manager]({{base_path}}/administer/key-managers/configure-forgerock-connector/)**

    WSO2 API Manager can connect to ForgeRock out-of-the-box using the [WSO2 API-M ForgeRock Connector](https://github.com/wso2-extensions/apim-km-forgerock). WSO2 API Manager has the capability to support multiple Key Managers at the same time. So with the use of connectors, it is capable of supporting any authorization server as a Key Manager, and in this case, it supports a connection to ForgeRock as a third-party Key Manager.

- **[Support for PingFederate Key Manager]({{base_path}}/administer/key-managers/configure-pingfederate-connector/)**

    WSO2 API Manager supports multiple Key Managers at the same time. As a result, WSO2 API Manager is prepacked with an inbuilt resident Key Manager, and with the use of connectors, it is capable of supporting any authorization server as a Key Manager. WSO2 API Manager can connect PingFederate out-of-the-box using the [WSO2 API-M PingFederate Connector](https://github.com/wso2-extensions/apim-km-pingfederate).

- **[Support for Auth0 Key Manager]({{base_path}}/administer/key-managers/configure-auth0-connector/)**

    It is possible to integrate the WSO2 API Manager with an external Identity and Access Management server (IAM) using the Auth0 OAuth Authorization Server to manage the OAuth clients and tokens that WSO2 API Manager requires. WSO2 API Manager has inbuilt support to consume APIs exposed by Auth0 OAuth.

- **[Streaming API support in API Gateway]({{base_path}}/design/create-api/create-streaming-api/streaming-api-overview)**

    Streaming APIs refer to APIs that have AsyncAPI definitions and use the **WebSocket**, **WebSub (WebHook)**, and **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** protocols. Streaming APIs are popular in the Event-driven architecture (EDA). With Streaming APIs, you can expose and manage **WebSocket**, **WebSub (WebHook)**, and **Server-Sent Events** backends in WSO2 API Manager. In WSO2 API Manager, Streaming APIs can be created by importing AsyncAPI definitions, and existing Streaming APIs can be exported as AsyncAPI definitions.

- **[Exposing APIs via Custom Hostnames (Virtual Hosts)]({{base_path}}/deploy-and-publish/deploy-on-gateway/deploy-api/exposing-apis-via-custom-hostnames)**

    **Virtual Host** enables you to deploy an API or API Product Revision to a Gateway with a custom hostname. Gateway environments and its virtual hosts can be managed via the Admin Portal, and the API Publisher can choose a host when deploying an API Revision or API Product Revision. 

- **TLSv1.3 support for API Gateway**

    API Gateway supports TLSv1.3 protocol and can be enabled to provide a stronger transport-level security.

<!--

- Changes to Publisher API/UI to support Streaming APIs

- Changes to Dev Portal REST API/UI to support Streaming APIs

- Improved Commenting Feature (Nested commenting, publisher view)

- Defaulting code and configs to do with event based
-->

### Removed features and functionalities

- Microgateway Labels

      [Grouping APIs with Microgateway Labels](https://apim.docs.wso2.com/en/3.2.0/learn/api-microgateway/grouping-apis-with-labels/)
      is removed from this release. Instead, you can use [Virtual Hosts (VHosts)]({{base_path}}/deploy-and-publish/deploy-on-gateway/deploy-api/exposing-apis-via-custom-hostnames)
      and dynamically manageable Gateway environments to group and expose APIs with custom hostnames.

### Key changes

- The name of the startup script has changed from `wso2server.sh` (Linux/Mac OS) and `wso2server.bat` (Windows) to `api-manager.sh` and `api-manager.bat` respectively. For instructions, see [Running the Product]({{base_path}}/install-and-setup/install/installing-the-product/running-the-api-m/).

- The endpoints mentioned below previously worked through the Gateway. In API-M 4.0.0, WSO2 has moved them separately as follows:   
    
    | **Until 3.2.0**        | **In 4.0.0**           |
    | :------------- |:-------------|
    | `https://<gateway-host>/token`      | `https://<keymanager-host>/oauth2/token` |
    | `https://<gateway-host>/revoke`      | `https://<keymanager-host>/oauth2/revoke`      |
    | `https://<gateway-host>/authorize`      | `https://<keymanager-host>/oauth2/authorize`      |
    | `https://<gateway-host>/userInfo` | `https://<keymanager-host>/oauth2/userInfo` |

- Distributed setup profiles were refactored to three profiles from APIM-4.0.0 onwards.
      
    | **Profile**        | **Description**           | **Startup Argument**  |
    | :------------- |:-------------| :-----|
    | Control Plane profile      | This profile contains the Publisher, Developer Portal, Key Manager, and Traffic Manager </br>components. </br>If you need to use the Traffic Manager profile separately, you need to disable </br>the Traffic Manager component in the Control Plane profile. </br>For more information, see [API-M 4.0.0 distributed setup documentation]({{base_path}}/install-and-setup/setup/distributed-deployment/understanding-the-distributed-deployment-of-wso2-api-m). | `-Dprofile=control-plane` |
    | Gateway profile      | The API Gateway profile.      |   `-Dprofile=gateway` |
    | Traffic Manager profile | The Traffic Manager profile.      |    `-Dprofile=traffic-manager` |

- API-related Synapse artifacts were moved from the file system to the in-memory. Therefore, there will not be any Synapse artifacts stored in the `<API-M_HOME>/repository/deployment/server/synapse-configs/default/api` directory. These Synapse artifacts are stored in the database and loaded to memory when the server starts up and when a new API revision is deployed and published.

- With the inclusion of API revisioning it is required to have an API revision deployed in a Gateway to be able to publish an API.

## **Micro Integrator**

The Micro Integrator is a cloud-native, standards-based messaging engine and an integration framework with a configuration-based runtime environment for integrating APIs, services, data, SaaS, proprietary, and legacy systems. This is a newly added component to WSO2 API Manager 4.0.0.

This serves the integration needs for the data plane of the API Manager platform.

It is now available to download from [here](https://wso2.com/api-management/#).

### New features

- **[New and improved File Connector]({{base_path}}/reference/connectors/file-connector/file-connector-overview/)**
    
	The File Connector allows you to connect to different file systems and perform various operations. The File Connector uses the [Apache Commons VFS](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-vfs/) I/O functionalities to execute operations. For more information, see **[File Connector Example]({{base_path}}/reference/connectors/file-connector/file-connector-example/)** and **[File Connector Reference]({{base_path}}/reference/connectors/file-connector/file-connector-config/)**.

- **[HashiCorp Secure Vault]({{base_path}}/install-and-setup/setup/mi-setup/security/using-hashicorp-secrets/)**
    
	By default, the Micro Integrator is configured to use WSO2 secure vault for encrypting secrets. However, you may encounter certain limitations with WSO2 secure vault if you use secrets with a large number of characters. You can overcome this issue by using HashiCorp secrets.

- **[JSON evaluation support for property mediator]({{base_path}}/reference/mediators/property-mediator/)**
    
	Enhanced JSON evaluation support was added for the property mediator.

- **[FreeMarker support PayloadFactory mediator]({{base_path}}/reference/mediators/payloadfactory-mediator/)**
    
	You can now use the **FreeMarker** template to write the payload. This is particularly useful when defining complex JSON payloads.

- **[OAuth endpoint](reference/synapse-properties/endpoint-properties/)**
    
	A message exit point or an endpoint defines an external destination for a message. Typically, this is the address of a proxy service that acts as the front-end to the actual service. You can configure the endpoint artifacts with any attributes or semantics needed for communicating with that service. An endpoint could represent a URL, a mailbox, a JMS queue, a TCP socket, etc., along with the settings needed for the connection.

- **[Call mediator improvement]({{base_path}}/reference/mediators/call-mediator/)**
    
	Improvements have been made to the call mediator so that it can now store the response to a property.

- **[Generating service catalog entry (open API definition)]({{base_path}}/integrate/develop/working-with-service-catalog/)**
    
	WSO2 API Manager includes a Service Catalog where developers can register their services in a RESTful manner. Integration services can be created when deploying your project as a C-App. These integration services are made discoverable to the API Management layer via the Service Catalog so that API proxies can directly be created using them.

- **[Data Service Call Mediator]({{base_path}}/reference/mediators/dss-mediator/)**

    Data Service Call mediator allows you to invoke data service operations from a mediation sequence without introducing an HTTP call (using the Call or Send mediators) 
    to access the data service.  This improves the server performance because the data service is accessed directly without going through the HTTP transport.
    
- **TLSv1.3 support for HTTP transport**

    The HTTP transport has been improved to support TLSv1.3 protocol to provide a stronger transport-level security.

## **Streaming Integrator**

Streaming Integrator serves the streaming-based integrations and acts as the event stream provider for Streaming APIs in the data plane of the API Manager platform. This is a newly added component into WSO2 API Manager 4.0.0.

It is now available to download from [here](https://github.com/wso2/streaming-integrator/releases/download/v4.0.0/wso2si-4.0.0.zip).

### New features

- **[Deploy AsyncAPI definitions to WSO2 API-M Services]({{base_path}}/use-cases/streaming-usecase/exposing-stream-as-managed-api-in-service-catalog/)**
    
	 WSO2 Streaming Integrator has the inbuilt capability to directly deploy siddhi applications with Async API definitions to WSO2 API Manager services. These services can then be used to create an API and deploy in the API Manager runtime.

- **SSE Sink / Source support over HTTP**
    
	 SSE is an HTTP-based protocol that allows one-way communication (similar to WebHooks) from the server to the client. For more information, see [SSE Server Sink](https://siddhi-io.github.io/siddhi-io-http/api/2.3.3/#sse-server-sink) and [SSE Source](https://siddhi-io.github.io/siddhi-io-http/api/2.3.3/#sse-source).
	 
- **WebSub Sink / Source support over HTTP**
    
	 Above Source and Sink implementation are based on the [WebSub](https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/) protocol specification.WebSubs only allows one-way communication, from a caller web app to a callee web app. For more information , see [WebSub Sink](https://siddhi-io.github.io/siddhi-io-http/api/2.3.3/#websubhub-sink) , [WebSub Source](https://siddhi-io.github.io/siddhi-io-http/api/2.3.3/#websubhub-source).

- **Improved MongoDB Store**
    
	 Several improvements are done, such as making the encryption protocol configurable, Object_ID support when searching specific values in the store, and other bug fixes. For more information, see [Mongo DB Store](https://siddhi-io.github.io/siddhi-store-mongodb/api/2.1.2/#mongodb-store).
	 
- **Improved IO CDC Source**
    
	 CDC(Change Data Capture) can be used to capture insert /update/delete actions from databases. With the new improvements, you can handle all three actions using a single CDC configuration. For more information, see [CDC Source](https://siddhi-io.github.io/siddhi-io-cdc/api/2.0.10/).
	 
- **Synchronous publishing support for IO Kafka**
    
	 IO Kafka allows seamless connection with the Kafka broker and retrieves the events into the Streaming Integrator. This release includes synchronous publishing of events, which allows more controlled event publishing and other bug fixes. For more information, see [IO-Kafka](https://github.com/siddhi-io/siddhi-io-kafka).
	 
- **Improved JSON Mapper to support null values**
    
	 JSON mapper provides capability to retrieve or publish events in JSON format. Release contains improvement where when null values arrives into the system they are treated as null values if needed. For more information , see [Map-JSON](https://github.com/siddhi-io/siddhi-map-json).
	 
- **Improved KeyValue Mapper to support force casting**
    
	 The KeyValue mapper allows the Streaming Integrator to get events and publish events as a key-value pair. For more information, see [Map-KeyValue](https://siddhi-io.github.io/siddhi-map-keyvalue/api/2.1.1/).
	 
- **Improved IO File Sink and Source**
    
	 IO File sink/source is used to read or write into a file. With the new improvements, the Streaming Integrator supports EOF(End Of File) in other modes, file trailers, file-writing mechanisms, and SFTP. For more information, see [IO-File](https://siddhi-io.github.io/siddhi-io-file/api/2.0.16/).
	 
- **Improved Store RDBMS support**
    
	 Store RDBMS can be used to connect with any RDBMS type. With the new versions, it supports adding null values to RDBMS tables and includes improved metrics support. For more information, see [Store RDBMS](https://github.com/siddhi-io/siddhi-store-rdbms).
	 
- **Kafka and HTTP metrics monitoring**
    
	 This release provides Kafka and HTTP metrics monitoring capability. In the previous release, this was only available for File, RDBMS and CDC(Change Data Capture). The metrics can be published to a pre-configured [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) server and then you can either create your own [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) dashboard or use the ETL dashboard which is already created by us. For more information on how to configure metrics, refer to [Monitoring ETL Flows](https://apim.docs.wso2.com/en/4.0.0/observe/si-observe/viewing-dashboards/) documentation page.

## **Streaming Integrator Tooling**

The Streaming Integrator Tooling is a developer tool to develop Siddhi applications and simulate events for testing purposes.

It is now available to download from [here](https://github.com/wso2/streaming-integrator-tooling/releases/).

### New features

- **Async API View**
    
	 This release introduces a new 'Async API' view in addition to the existing 'Source/Design' views and 'Wizard' view. 
	 
	 Using the Async API View, you can generate an [Async API](https://www.asyncapi.com/) specification for a given Siddhi app. 
	 
	 The following sinks/sources can be exposed as an Async API : [websocket-server (sink)](https://siddhi-io.github.io/siddhi-io-websocket/api/3.0.2/#websocket-server-sink),  [web socket-server (source)](https://siddhi-io.github.io/siddhi-io-websocket/api/3.0.2/#websocket-server-source), [websocket (source)](https://siddhi-io.github.io/siddhi-io-websocket/api/3.0.2/#websocket-source), [sse-server (sink)](https://siddhi-io.github.io/siddhi-io-http/api/2.3.3/#sse-server-sink), [websubhub (source)](https://siddhi-io.github.io/siddhi-io-http/api/2.3.3/#websubhub-source)
     
      See the [example use case](https://apim.docs.wso2.com/en/4.0.0/use-cases/streaming-usecase/exposing-stream-as-managed-api-in-service-catalog/).

- **Tooling support for webhubsub Source and webhubsub Sink**
    
	 Tooling support is added for the newly introduced [webhubsub source](https://siddhi-io.github.io/siddhi-io-http/api/2.3.3/#websubhub-source) and [webhubsub sink](https://siddhi-io.github.io/siddhi-io-http/api/2.3.3/#websubhub-sink). For details, see the **Streaming Integrator - New Features** section above.

- **Tooling support for SSE Source and SSE-server Sink**

	 Tooling support is added for the newly introduced [SSE Source](https://siddhi-io.github.io/siddhi-io-http/api/2.3.3/#sse-source) and [SSE-server Sink](https://siddhi-io.github.io/siddhi-io-http/api/2.3.3/#sse-server-sink). For details, see the **Streaming Integrator - New Features** section above.
	 
- **Siddhi Error Replay for 'Store' type errors**

	 This release enables **error replay** for database connection errors. Errors that occur during ADD, DELETE, UPDATE, ADDORUPDATE operations can be replayed from the Error Store explorer. 
	 
	 See the tutorial on [handling store-type errors](https://apim.docs.wso2.com/en/4.0.0/use-cases/streaming-tutorials/handling-requests-with-errors/#step-7-handle-events-that-fail-at-database-level).

## Choreo Connect

The Choreo Connect is a lightweight gateway for APIs. It is used for message security, transport security, routing, and other common API Management related quality of services. It can collect information required for usage metering and throttling capabilities. The Choreo Connect natively supports scaling in highly decentralized environments including microservice architecture.

#### New features

Please see the [supported features]({{base_path}}/deploy-and-publish/deploy-on-gateway/choreo-connect/getting-started/supported-features/)


## **Kubernetes API Operator**

Microservices are increasingly being deployed on Kubernetes. As a result, it is important to expose these microservices as well documented, easy to consume, managed APIs so that they can be used to develop great applications. The API operator for Kubernetes makes APIs a first-class citizen in the Kubernetes ecosystem. Similar to deploying microservices, you can now use this operator to deploy APIs for individual microservices or compose several microservices into individual APIs. With this, users can expose their microservice as managed APIs in the Kubernetes environment without any additional work.

The API operator for Kubernetes provides first-class support for Micro Integrator deployments in the Kubernetes ecosystem. It uses the Integration custom resource (`integration_cr.yaml` file) that is available in the Kubernetes project (exported from WSO2 Integration Studio) and deploys the integration in your Kubernetes environment.

It is now available to download from [here](https://github.com/wso2/k8s-api-operator/releases/).
K8s API Operator v2.0.0 is compatible with API Manager v4.0.0.

### New features

- Deploy APIs to Choreo Connect (API Microgateway)
- Deploy APIs to API Manager
- Deploy Integrations with Micro Integrator
