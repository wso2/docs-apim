# Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **API** | An API (Application Programming Interface) is the fundamental building block of WSO2 API Manager. It acts as a secure, controlled, and well-documented communication protocol between a consumer and a service, hiding the underlying implementation details. |
| **API Format** | The **Open API Specification (OAS, formerly known as Swagger)** is the industry-standard format used for defining and describing the structure of RESTful APIs. It is the underlying representation of an API in WSO2 API Manager and is used for importing, viewing, and editing API definitions. |
| **API Resource path and HTTP Methods** | An API is composed of one or more resources, each with a unique URI (resource path). Each resource supports a set of **HTTP methods** (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, HEAD, and OPTIONS) that define the operation to be performed. |
| **API Lifecycle** | The stages that an API progresses through from creation to retirement. The states are **CREATED, PRE-RELEASED, PUBLISHED, BLOCKED, DEPRECATED, and RETIRED**. This lifecycle is independent of the backend services. |
| **Application** | The logical representation of a physical consuming application (e.g., mobile app, web app). To use an API, the application must **subscribe** to it over a selected business plan, receiving a consumer-key and consumer-secret as credentials. |
| **API Product** | A **marketable offering** that bundles carefully selected resources from one or more underlying technical APIs. It allows API Product Managers to create simplified, business-focused consumption packages that applications can subscribe to. |
| **Access Token** | A credential, typically an **OAuth 2.0 bearer token**, that is passed in an HTTP header of an API request. It is a secure string that grants the consumer **authorization** (permission) to access a specific API for a limited duration. WSO2 API Manager supports **JWT** formatted tokens. |
| **API Visibility** | Determines who can view the API on the Developer Portal. Levels include **Public**, **Restricted by role**, and **Visible to my domain**. |
| **Rate Limits** | Policies that limit the number of permitted requests to an API within a given time window. They are crucial for protecting against **Denial of Service (DoS)** attacks, regulating traffic, and enforcing monetization quotas. |
| **Workflows** | Mechanisms that enable human approval processes and custom logic for user actions (e.g., subscription approval) on the Publisher and Developer Portals. They are asynchronous, using webhooks to put actions on hold. |
| **Message Mediation Policies** | Used within the Universal Gateway to **enrich, transform, or modify** a request or response message. Examples include converting message formats (e.g., XML to JSON) or performing custom validations. |
| **Handler** | A component that processes a message before it is passed to the routing logic of the Universal Gateway. Handlers are used for security validation, policy enforcement, event pushing, and custom logging. |
| **Tags** | Labels used by API providers to categorize and group APIs with similar attributes. Tags appear as clickable links on the Developer Portal, helping consumers with search and discovery. |
| **Tenant** | A logically isolated entity (e.g., an organizational unit) in a WSO2 API Manager deployment. **Multi-tenancy** allows multiple tenants to share the same deployment while maintaining a personalized, individual scope. |
| **Service Catalog** | An attribute enabling **API-first Integration** by making integration services discoverable to the API Management layer, allowing API proxies to be created directly from these services. |
| **API Publisher Role** | The API product manager who manages a set of APIs/API Products, controlling the **API lifecycle, subscriptions, and monetization** aspects. They also analyze API usage statistics. |
| **API Creator Role** | A technical role responsible for the **design and development** of APIs (interfaces, documentation, versions) using the API Publisher Portal. |
| **API Subscriber Role** | The API consumer who uses the Developer Portal to discover, read documentation, rate, **subscribe**, obtain keys, and finally use APIs within their own applications. |
| **Admin Role** | The user responsible for managing the Admin Portal, handling tasks such as workflow approvals, rate limiting policy management, and general administrative tasks (users, roles, security). |
