# Creating a New Connector

You can write a new connector for a specific requirement that cannot be addressed via any of the existing connectors that can be downloaded from the [connector store](https://store.wso2.com/store/pages/top-assets).

Follow the steps given below to write a new connector to integrate with the **Google Books** service. You can then use the connector inside a mediation sequence to connect with Google Books and get information.

## Writing a new connector

Follow the steps given below to write the new connector.

### Prerequisites

Download and install Apache Maven.

### Step 1: Creating the Maven project template

We will use the [maven archetype](https://github.com/wso2-extensions/archetypes/tree/master/esb-connector-archetype) to generate the Maven project template and sample connector code. 

1.  Open a terminal, navigate to the directory on your machine where you want the new connector to be created, and run the following command:

    ```xml
    mvn org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-archetype-plugin:2.4:generate -DarchetypeGroupId=org.wso2.carbon.extension.archetype -DarchetypeArtifactId=org.wso2.carbon.extension.esb.connector-archetype -DarchetypeVersion=2.0.4 -DgroupId=org.wso2.carbon.esb.connector -DartifactId=org.wso2.carbon.esb.connector.googlebooks -Dversion=1.0.0 -DarchetypeRepository=http://maven.wso2.org/nexus/content/repositories/wso2-public/
    ```
2.  When prompted, enter a name for the connector. For example, **googleBooks**.
3.  When prompted for confirmation, enter **y**. 
    
The `org.wso2.carbon.esb.connector.googlebooks` directory is now created with a directory structure consisting of a `pom.xml` file, `src`tree, and `repository` tree.

### Step 2: Adding the new connector resources

Now, let's configure files in the `org.wso2.carbon.esb.connector.googlebooks/src/main/resources` directory:

1.  Create a directory named **googlebooks_volume** in the `/src/main/resources` directory.
2.  Create a file named `listVolume.xml` with the following content in the **googlebooks_volume** directory:
    ```xml
    <template name="listVolume" xmlns="http://ws.apache.org/ns/synapse">
    <parameter name="searchQuery" description="Full-text search query string." />
        <sequence>
          <property name="uri.var.searchQuery" expression="$func:searchQuery" />
            <call>
                <endpoint>
                    <http method="get" uri-template="https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?q={uri.var.searchQuery}" />
                </endpoint>
            </call>
        </sequence>
    </template>
    ```

3.  Create a file named `component.xml` in the **googlebooks_volume** directory and add the following content:
    ```xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <component name="googlebooks_volume" type="synapse/template">
        <subComponents>
            <component name="listVolume">
                <file>listVolume.xml</file>
                <description>Lists volumes that satisfy the given query.</description>
            </component>
        </subComponents>
    </component>
    ```

4.  Edit the `connector.xml` file in the `src/main/resources` directory and replace the contents with the following dependency:
    ```xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <connector>
        <component name="googleBooks" package="org.wso2.carbon.connector" >
          <dependency component="googlebooks_volume"/>
            <description>wso2 sample connector library</description>
        </component>
    </connector>
    ```

5. Create a folder named **icon** in the `/src/main/resources` directory and add two icons.

    !!! Tip
        You can download icons from the following location: [icons](http://svn.wso2.org/repos/wso2/scratch/connectors/icons/)

You are now ready to build the connector.

### Step 3: Building the connector

Open a terminal, navigate to the `org.wso2.carbon.esb.connector.googlebooks` directory and execute the following maven command:

```bash
mvn clean install
```

This builds the connector and generates a ZIP file named `googleBooks-connector-1.0.0.zip` in the `target` directory.

## Using the new connector

Now, let's look at how you can use the new connector in a mediation sequence.

### Step 1: Adding the connector to your mediation sequence

1. [Set up WSO2 Integration Studio](../../../develop/installing-WSO2-Integration-Studio).
2. [Create an ESB Config project](../../../develop/creating-projects/#esb-config-project) and [import the connector](../../../develop/creating-artifacts/adding-connectors/#importing-connectors) to your project.

    !!! Tip
        Be sure to select the new `googleBooks-connector-1.0.0.zip` file from your `org.wso2.carbon.esb.connector.googlebooks/target` directory.

3. [Create a custom proxy service](../../../develop/creating-artifacts/creating-a-proxy-service) named **googlebooks_listVolume**. In the **Design View**, you will note that the new connector is added to the tool palette.
    <img src="../../../assets/img/create_artifacts/new-connector-pallet.png" width="500">

4. Now, update the proxy service as shown below. You will be defining a mediation logic using the **Propertry** mediator, the new **googleBooks** connector, and the **Respond** mediator:
    ```xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <proxy xmlns="http://ws.apache.org/ns/synapse"
           name="googlebooks_listVolume"
           transports="https,http"
           statistics="disable"
           trace="disable"
           startOnLoad="true">
       <target>
          <inSequence>
             <property name="searchQuery" expression="json-eval($.searchQuery)"/>
             <googleBooks.listVolume>
                <searchQuery>{$ctx:searchQuery}</searchQuery>
             </googleBooks.listVolume>
             <respond/>
          </inSequence>
       </target>
       <description/>
    </proxy>
    ```

### Step 2: Packaging all the artifacts

You need to package the new connector file and the proxy service separately.

1. Create a **Connector Exporter project** and add the connector.

    See the instructions on [packaging a new connector file](../../../develop/creating-artifacts/adding-connectors/#packaging-connectors).

2. Create a new **Composite Application project** and add the proxy service as well as the connector as dependencies.

    !!! Tip
        Note that you need to add both the **Connector Exporter project** as well as the **ESB Config project** as dependencies because the connector is referred from the proxy service.

    <img src="../../../assets/img/create_artifacts/new-capp-project-with-depenencies.png" width="500">

    See the instructions on [packaging ESB artifacts](../../../develop/packaging-artifacts/#creating-a-new-composite-application).

### Step 3: Deploying the artifacts

1.  Open the POM file for the composite application project and ensure that the **Connector Exporter** project as well as the **ESB Config** project are selected as dependencies.
    
    <img src="../../../assets/img/create_artifacts/capp-dependencies.png" width="500">
    
2.  Right-click the Composite Application project and click **Export Project Artifacts and Run**. 

The embedded Micro Integrator will now start and deploy the artifacts.

### Step 4: Testing the connector

Post a request to the proxy service using Curl as shown below.

```bash
curl -v -X POST -d "{"searchQuery":"rabbit"}" -H "Content-Type: application/json"  http://localhost:8290/services/googlebooks_listVolume 
```

This performs a search and displays a list of volumes that meet the specified search criteria.
