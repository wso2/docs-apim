export it into a CAR file (.car file):

    right-click, and click **Export Composite Application Project** .  
    ![export artifacts]({{base_path}}/assets/img/integrate/create_project/export_esb_artifacts.png)
2.  In the dialog that opens, give a name for the CAR file, the destination where the file should be saved, and click **Next**.
3.  You can select the artifacts that should be packaged in the CAR file.
4.  Click **Finish** to generate the CAR file.
