# Exporting a Project

With WSO2 Integration Studio, you can export projects from your workspace and later [import them](../importing-projects).

For example, consider the following [**Maven Multi Module** project](../create-multi-maven-project) in your project explorer. This is a project solution that includes several project types.

    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>
                Projects Export as Archive File
            </th>
            <td>
                Select this option to export the project as a ZIP archive.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>
                Projects Export as File System
            </th>
            <td>
                Select this option to export the project folders without creating a ZIP archive.
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    
4.  In the next page, see that your root project folder is selected. Click **Browse** and give the path to the export location. 

    !!! Tip
        If you have other projects in your workspace, you can also select them if required.
