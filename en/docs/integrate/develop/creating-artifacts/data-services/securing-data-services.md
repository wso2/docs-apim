# Applying Security to a Data Service

WSO2 supports WS-Security, WS-Policy, and WS-Security Policy
specifications. These specifications define a behavioral model for Web
services. To enable a security policy for a data service, you need to
first create a security policy file, and then add it to the data
service.

## Prerequisites

Be sure to [configure a user store]({{base_path}}/install-and-setup/setup/mi-setup/setup/user_stores/setting_up_a_userstore) for the Micro Integrator and add the required users and roles.

## Step 1: Creating a registry resource module

Registry artifacts (such as security policy files) should be stored in a
**Registry Resource** module. Follow the steps given below to create a
module:

1.  Right click on the [Integration project]({{base_path}}/integrate/develop/create-integration-project) 
    and goto **New → Registry Resource**. 
    
    !!! Tip Alternatively, you can goto **File → New → Others** and 
    select **Registry Resources** from the opening wizard.

2.  Enter a name for the module and click **Next** .
3.  Enter the Maven information about the module and click **Finish** .
4.  The new module will be listed in the project explorer.

## Step 2: Creating a security policy as a registry resource

1.  Right-click the registry resource module in the left navigation
    panel, click **New**, and then click **Registry Resource**. This
    will open the **New Registry Resource** window.
2.  Select the **From existing template** option as shown below and
    click **Next** .  
    ![]({{base_path}}/assets/img/integrate/tutorials/data_services/119130577/119130583.png)
3.  Enter the following details:

    | Property      |    Value       |
    |---------------|----------------|
    | Resource Name | Sample_Policy  |
    | Artifact Name | Sample_Policy  |
    | Template      | WS-Policy      |
    | Registry      | gov            |
    | Registry path | ws-policy/     |

4.  Click **Finish** and the policy file will be listed in the
    navigator.
    1.  Let's use the **Design View** to enable the required security
        scenario. For example, enable the **Sign and Encyrpt** security
        scenario.

        !!! Tip
            Click the icon next to the scenario to get details of the scenario.
          
        ![]({{base_path}}/assets/img/integrate/tutorials/data_services/119130577/119130596.png)

    2.  You can also provide encryption properties, signature
        properties, and advanced rampart configurations.

        !!! Info
            **Using role-based permissions?**
        
            For certain scenarios, you can specify user roles. After you select the scenario, scroll to the right to see the **User Roles** button. Either define the user roles inline or retrieve the user roles from the server.
                
        !!! Info
            Switch to source view of the policy file and make sure the tokenStoreClass in the policy file is 'org.wso2.micro.integrator.security.extensions.SecurityTokenStore'.
            In addition, replace the ServerCrypto class with 'org.wso2.micro.integrator.security.util.ServerCrypto' if present.
        
5.  Save the policy file.

## Step 2: Adding the security policy to the data service

Once you have configured the policy file, you can add the security
policy to the data service as explained below.

1.  If you have already created a data service using WSO2 Integration
    Studio, select the file from the Project Explorer.

    !!! Tip
        Be sure to update your database credentials in the dataservice file.
    
2.  Once you have opened the data service file, switch to the **Source View** to see 
the source of the data service.

3.  Add the following elements inside the `<data>` element and save the file.
    ```xml
     <policy key="gov:ws-policy/Sample_Policy.xml" />
     <enableSec />
    ```

## Step 3: Package the artifacts

See the instructions on [packaging the artifacts]({{base_path}}/integrate/develop/packaging-artifacts) into a composite exporter.

## Step 4: Build and run the artifacts

See the instructions [deploying the artifacts]({{base_path}}/integrate/develop/deploy-artifacts).

## Step 5: Testing the service

Create a Soap UI project with the relevant security settings and then send the request to the hosted service.

For guidelines on using SoapUI, see [general guidelines on testing with SOAP UI]({{base_path}}/integrate/develop/advanced-development/applying-security-to-a-proxy-service/#general-guidelines-on-testing-with-soap-ui).

## Using an encrypted datasource password

When you create a data service for an RDBMS datasource, you have the
option of encrypting the datasource connection password. This ensures
that the password is encrypted in the configuration file (.dbs file) of
the data service.

See the instructions on [encrypting plain-text passwords]({{base_path}}/install-and-setup/setup/mi-setup/security/encrypting_plain_text)

Once you have encrypted the datasource password, you can update the data
service as explained below.

1.  Open the data service and click **Data Sources** to expand the section.
    ![]({{base_path}}/assets/img/integrate/tutorials/data_services/data_source_expanded.png)
2.  Click on the **Edit** icon of the respective Datasource to open 
    **Edit Datasource** page.
    ![]({{base_path}}/assets/img/integrate/tutorials/data_services/edit_datasource.png)
3.  Make sure to check **Use as a Secret Alias**.
4.  Update the Secret Alias and click on **Save**.
