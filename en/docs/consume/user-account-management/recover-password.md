# Recover Password

!!! note
    The password recovery feature does not work out-of-the-box because an email server needs to be configured to be able to send the password recovery email. For more information, see [Enable Password Recovery]({{base_path}}/install-and-setup/setup/security/user-account-management/#enable-password-recovery).

1.  Click **Forgot Password** on the Sign In page and request a password change.

     You will receive an email with instructions to reset your password.

     The password recovery email is sent to the email address that is provided during the Developer Portal user sign up process.
