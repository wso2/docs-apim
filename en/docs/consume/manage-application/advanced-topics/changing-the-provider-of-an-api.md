# Changing the Provider of an Api

IfÂ required, you can transfer the ownership of your api to another user in your organization. Thereby, when transferring ownership, the new provider/owner will have the required permission to delete or edit the respective api.

For example, let's consider that **Chris** and **Kim** are in the same organization and that **Kim** owns testApi and he wants to transfer the ownership of testApi to **Chris**.

Follow the instructions below to change the ownership of an application:

1.  Start the WSO2 API-M Server.
2.  If the users do not exist in the system, create them.

     1. Sign in to the WSO2 API-M Management Console.

         `https://<APIM-hostname>:9443/carbon`

     2. Create two users named **Chris** and **Kim** with the `Internal/creator` role.
        Refer [Create New Users]({{base_path}}/administer/managing-users-and-roles/managing-users#adding-a-new-user) for more information.

3.  We can check the current provider by logging to the publisher portal and by looking at the api tiles.

    1.  Sign in to the WSO2 API-M Publisher Portal using the api owner's (Kim's) user credentials.

         `https://<APIM-hostname>:9443/publisher`

    2.  If the apis does not exist, create it in the Publisher Portal.

4.  Change the owner/provider of the api.

    1.  Sign in to the WSO2 API-M Admin Portal using admin credentials.
        
         `https://<APIM-hostname>:9443/admin`

    2.  Click **Change Api Provider** under **Settings**.
        This shows you the list of apis together with the respective providers.

    3.  Search for the apis that you want to change and click **Edit**.

    4.  Update the **Provider** field with the new provider's username (Chris).

        !!! Troubleshooting
            If you get a "`Not a valid user `" error (e.g., Chris123 not is a valid user) in the Admin Portal, make sure to request that specific user (e.g., Kim) by checking the spellings.


        The apis page shows the new ownership.

        Now, when Kim or Chris signs in to the publisher Portal, the provider name is changed to Chris.
