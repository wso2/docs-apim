# Test APIs with API Chat

Testing APIs is an essential step in the API development lifecycle. API Manager simplifies the testing task by allowing you to engage with your APIs using natural language through API Chat. It eliminates manual test scenario creation, payload mocking, etc. It enables easy API communication using human language and requires no coding for handling sequences with multiple resource calls. This makes your API testing efficient and user-friendly.

!!! info
    This feature is currently in the **experimental** stage and supports both REST APIs with OpenAPI V3.0.x definitions and GraphQL APIs. Other API types including REST APIs using Swagger or OpenAPI V3.1.x specifications are not currently supported.

Follow the steps below to test your API with API Chat:

!!! tip
    If you've previously registered your environment for the [Marketplace Assistant]({{base_path}}/consume/discover-apis/marketplace-assistant), you can skip Step 1 and 2 by utilizing the same credentials for the API Chat. Otherwise, complete Step 1 and 2 to generate the credentials.

## Step 1 - Sign in to AI Subscription Portal

!!! warning
        Information in the AI Subscription Portal will be stored in the United States.

1. Navigate to the AI Subscription Portal using the following URL: <a href="https://ai-subscriptions.wso2.com">https://ai-subscriptions.wso2.com</a>.

2. Register for an Account.

   [![AI Subscription Portal]({{base_path}}/assets/img/observe/ai-subscription-portal.png)]({{base_path}}/assets/img/observe/ai-subscription-portal.png)

   - Click **Register**.
   - Enter a valid email address and click **Register**.
   - Check your email inbox and click **Complete Account Creation**.
   - Provide an organization name (make a note of this, as it will be required for every login) and create a secure password.

3. Login to the AI Subscription Portal.

   - Click **Sign In** and enter your organization name.
   - Enter your email address and password.

## Step 2 - Create a key by subscribing

1. On the main landing page, click **New Subscription**.

      [![AI Subscription Portal Initial Dashboard]({{base_path}}/assets/img/observe/ai-subscription-portal-2.png)]({{base_path}}/assets/img/observe/ai-subscription-portal-2.png)

2. Select **wso2am** as the product, enter an appropriate name, and create the subscription.

    !!! info
        Users can create multiple subscriptions for different on-premises environments and manage them through the portal.

    !!! warning
        Do not use the same key for different environments or products. Each key is used to differentiate environments when accessing AI services.

    [![AI Subscription Portal Dashboard]({{base_path}}/assets/img/observe/ai-subscription-portal-3.png)]({{base_path}}/assets/img/observe/ai-subscription-portal-3.png)

    !!! warning
        Users can revoke and regenerate keys for any subscription, as well as delete subscriptions. Please perform these actions with caution, as they will immediately invalidate any existing keys in use.

## Step 3 - Configure API Manager

1. The following configuration change must be done in the `<API-M_HOME>/repository/conf/deployment.toml` file. Update the `[apim.ai]` config by providing the on-premise token obtained from Step 2. Also, be sure to update the endpoint field as below.

      ```toml
      [apim.ai]
      enable = true
      endpoint = "https://dev-tools.wso2.com/apim-ai-service/v2"
      key = "<use key that you generated>"
      token_endpoint = "https://api.asgardeo.io/t/wso2devtools/oauth2/token"
      ```

2. Restart the API Manager.

## Step 4 - Test your APIs

Now we can begin testing APIs. API Chat supports both REST and GraphQL APIs. Let's explore how to test each type of API.

### Testing REST APIs

This section covers the API Chat capabilities using the `PizzaShack` REST API, which was created in [Create a REST API]({{base_path}}/design/create-api/create-rest-api/create-a-rest-api/).

1.  Sign in to the WSO2 Developer Portal (`https://<hostname>:9443/devportal`) and click on the API that you need to test (e.g., `PizzaShack`).

2.  Subscribe to the API (e.g., `PizzaShackAPI` 1.0.0)Â using an application and an available throttling policy.

    [![Subscribe to an API]({{base_path}}/assets/img/learn/subscribe-to-api.png)]({{base_path}}/assets/img/learn/subscribe-to-api.png)

3. Next, generate either a production key or a sandbox key using one of the following actions. You have to scroll down and click **Generate Keys**.

    [![Generate production keys]({{base_path}}/assets/img/learn/generate-application-keys.png)]({{base_path}}/assets/img/learn/generate-application-keys.png)

4. Optionally, click on **Generate Access Token** and copy the generated token.

5.  Now visit the **API Chat** tab under the **Try Out** section. Since the API Chat will test your API based on your natural language query, it needs access to the API. As per the warning shown below, we need to provide an API access token. Either click on the link given in the banner or click **CONFIGURE KEY** to generate one.

    [![API Chat Landing Page]({{base_path}}/assets/img/get_started/api-chat.png)]({{base_path}}/assets/img/get_started/api-chat.png)

6.  Enter the copied access token in the **Authorization** field or click on **GET TEST KEY**.

    [![Add Access Token]({{base_path}}/assets/img/get_started/api-chat-access-token.png)]({{base_path}}/assets/img/get_started/api-chat-access-token.png)

    !!! tip

         TEST KEY will be generated with default scopes. If you need to generate a token with specific scopes, go to the application view and generate a token.

7. Now you can enter your query in natural language and execute it.
    
     Note that we provide some samples that you can try. They cover the following 3 scenarios:

      I. Invoke all resources of the API

      II. Invoke a single resource of the API
      
      III. Invoke an action involving multiple resources
   
    Let's provide our own query for this guide: _First get me the menu. Then, create a new Order with customerName 'John Smith', pizzaType 'Pepperoni', and quantity 2. Then update the same Order and change the pizzaType to 'Margherita'._

    [![API Chat Query]({{base_path}}/assets/img/get_started/api-chat-query.png)]({{base_path}}/assets/img/get_started/api-chat-query.png)

8. Let's analyse the result from API Chat. As shown below, 3 resources were invoked sequentially. Namely:

    GET &rarr; Retrieval of the menu

    POST &rarr; Placing a new order

    PUT &rarr; Updating the order

    [![API Chat Response]({{base_path}}/assets/img/get_started/api-chat-response.png)]({{base_path}}/assets/img/get_started/api-chat-response.png)

### Testing GraphQL APIs

This section covers the API Chat capabilities using the `StarWars` GraphQL API, which was created in [Create a GraphQL API]({{base_path}}/design/create-api/create-graphql-api/create-a-graphql-api/).

1. Follow the steps 1-6 outlined in the API Chat testing for REST APIs section with your GraphQL API. The overall process remains the same.

2. For a GraphQL API, you can now enter natural language queries specific to your API schema. 
   
    Note that we provide some samples that you can try. They cover the following 3 scenarios:

    I. Invoke a simple data retrieval operation of the API

    II. Invoke a complex data retrieval with relationships of the API
      
    III. Invoke a data modification operation of the API

3. Let's provide our own query for this guide: 
   
    _First get me a list of all human characters using allHumans. Then fetch details for the human with ID "1000" including their name, height, and which films they appeared in. Next, show me all reviews for the NEWHOPE episode. Finally, create a new review for NEWHOPE with a 5-star rating and the comment "A timeless classic!"_

    [![API Chat GraphQL Query]({{base_path}}/assets/img/get_started/graphql-api-chat-query.png)]({{base_path}}/assets/img/get_started/graphql-api-chat-query.png)

4. Let's analyse the result from API Chat. As shown below, several GraphQL operations were invoked sequentially:

    **QUERY (List)** &rarr; Retrieving a list of all human characters using the `allHumans` query
    
    **QUERY (Detail)** &rarr; Fetching a specific human's details by ID using the `human` query
    
    **QUERY (Collection)** &rarr; Retrieving all reviews for a specific episode using the `reviews` query
    
    **MUTATION** &rarr; Creating a new review for an episode using the `createReview` mutation

    !!! info
        While API Chat can understand and process requests for GraphQL subscriptions, please note that it currently cannot establish and maintain the persistent WebSocket connections required for executing actual subscription operations. The subscription part of your query will be acknowledged but not fully executed in real-time.
