# Managing Streaming Data with Errors

## Introduction

In this tutorial, let's learn how you can handle streaming data that has errors (e.g., events that do not have values for certain attributes). WSO2 Streaming Integrator allows you to log such events, direct them to a separate stream or store them in a data store. If these errors occur at the time of publishing (e.g., due to a connection error), WSO2 SI also provides the option to wait and then resume to publish once the connection is stable again. For detailed information about different ways to handle errors, see the [Handling Errors guide]({{base_path}}/use-cases/streaming-tutorials/handling-errors).

In this scenario, you are handling erroneous events by directing them to a MySQL store.

## Before you begin

In order to save streaming data with errors in a MySQL store, complete the following prerequisites.
   
- Start the SI server by navigating to the `<SI_HOME>/bin` directory and issuing one of the following commands as appropriate, based on your operating system:

    - For Windows: `server.bat --run`
    - For Linux:  `sh server.sh`

  The following log appears in the Streaming Integrator console once you have successfully started the server.

    ```
    INFO {org.wso2.carbon.kernel.internal.CarbonStartupHandler} - WSO2 Streaming Integrator started in 4.240 sec
    ```
  
- You need to have access to a MySQL instance.    
      
## Step 1: Create the data store

Let's create the MySQL data store in which the events with errors can be saved. To do this, follow the steps below:

1. Download the MySQL JDBC driver from [the MySQL site](https://dev.mysql.com/get/Downloads/Connector-J/mysql-connector-java-5.1.45.tar.gz).

2. Unzip the archive.

3. Copy the `mysql-connector-java-5.1.45-bin.jar` to the `<SI_HOME>/lib` directory.

4. Start the MySQL server as follows:

    `mysql -u <USERNAME> -p <PASSWORD>`
    
5. Create a new database named `use siddhierrorstoredb;` by issuing the following command in the MySQL console.

    ``mysql> create database siddhierrorstoredb;``
    
6. To switch to the new database, issue the following command.

    `mysql> use siddhierrorstoredb;`

## Step 2: Enable the error store

To enable the error store, open the `<SI_HOME>/conf/server/deployment.yaml` file and add a configuration as follows:

```
error.store:
  enabled: true
  bufferSize: 1024
  dropWhenBufferFull: true
  errorStore: org.wso2.carbon.streaming.integrator.core.siddhi.error.handler.DBErrorStore
  config:
    datasource: SIDDHI_ERROR_STORE_DB
    table: SIDDHI_ERROR_STORE_TABLE
```

This configuration refers to a data source named `Error_Store_DB`. Define this data source as follows under `Data sources` in the `<SI_HOME>/conf/server/deployment.yaml` file.

```
- name: SIDDHI_ERROR_STORE_DB
  description: The datasource used for Siddhi error handling feature
  jndiConfig:
    name: jdbc/SiddhiErrorStoreDB
  definition:
    type: RDBMS
    configuration:
      jdbcUrl: 'jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/siddhierrorstoredb?useSSL=false'
      username: root
      password: root
      driverClassName: com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
      minIdle: 5
      maxPoolSize: 50
      idleTimeout: 60000
      connectionTestQuery: SELECT 1
      validationTimeout: 30000
      isAutoCommit: false
```

## Step 3: Create and deploy the Siddhi application

To create and deploy a Siddhi application, follow the steps below:

1. Start the Streaming Integrator Tooling by navigating to the `<SI_TOOLING_HOME>/bin` directory and issuing one of the following commands as appropriate, based on your operating system:

    - For Windows: `tooling.bat`

    - For Linux: `./tooling.sh`
    
    Then access the Streaming Integrator Tooling via the URL that appears in the start up log with the text `Editor Started on:`.
    
2. Copy paste the following three Siddhi applications to four separate new files and save.

    ```
        @App:name("MappingErrorTest")
        
        @Source(type = 'http',
                 receiver.url='http://localhost:8006/productionStream',
                 basic.auth.enabled='false',
        	 @map(type='json', @attributes(name='name', amount='amount')))
        define stream ProductionStream(name string, amount double);
        
        @sink(type='log', prefix='Successful mapping: ')
        define stream LogStream(name string, amount double);
        
        from ProductionStream
        select *
        insert into LogStream;
    ```
    ```
       @App:name("SinkTransportErrorTest")
       
       @sink(type = 'http', on.error='STORE', blocking.io='true', 
             publisher.url = "http://localhost:8090/unavailableEndpoint", 
             method = "POST", @map(type = 'json'))
       define stream TestPublisherStream (name string, amount double);
       
       @Source(type = 'http', receiver.url='http://localhost:8007/testUnavailableEP', 
               basic.auth.enabled='false', 
               @map(type='json', enclosing.element='$.event', 
                   @attributes(name='name', amount='amount')))
       define stream TestInput(name string, amount double);
       
       from TestInput#log('Sending to unavailableEndpoint: ')
       select name, amount
       insert into TestPublisherStream;
    ```
    ```
       @App:name("ReceiveAndCount")
       
       @App:description('Receive events via HTTP transport and view the output on the console')
       
       @Source(type = 'http',
               receiver.url='http://localhost:8090/unavailableEndpoint',
               basic.auth.enabled='false',
               @map(type='json'))
       define stream SweetProductionStream (name string, amount double);
       
       @sink(type='log')
       define stream TotalCountStream (totalCount long);
       
       -- Count the incoming events
       @info(name='query1')
       from SweetProductionStream
       select count() as totalCount
       insert into TotalCountStream;
    ```

    ```
    @App:name("StoreRdbmsError")
    @App:description('Receive events via HTTP and persist the received data in the store.')
        
    @sink(type='log')
    define stream LogStream(batchID int, amount double, factoryID int);
        
    @Store(type="rdbms",
            on.error="STORE",
            jdbc.url="jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/production?useSSL=false",
            username="root",
            password="root",
            jdbc.driver.name="com.mysql.jdbc.Driver")
    @primaryKey('batchID')
    define table SweetProductionTable (batchID int, amount double, factoryID int);
        
    @Source(type = 'http',
            receiver.url='http://localhost:8006/insertStream',
            basic.auth.enabled='false',
            @map(type='json'))
    define stream InsertStream (batchID int, amount double, factoryID int);
        
    from InsertStream
    insert into SweetProductionTable;
    ```

3. To deploy the Siddhi file, follow the procedure below:

    1. Click the **Deploy** menu and then click **Deploy to Server**. This opens the **Deploy Siddhi Apps to Server** dialog box.
    
    2. In the **Add New Server** section, enter the host, port, user name and the password of your Streaming Integrator server as shown below.
    
        !!! Tip
            To check the port of your streaming integrator server, open the `<SI_HOME>/conf/server/deployment.yaml file` and search for `wso2.transport.http` -> `Listener Configurations`. The port of your WSO2 Streaming Integrator port is specified under the listener configuration that has `msf4j-https` as the ID as shown in the extract below. In this example, it is `9443`.<br/><br/>
            ```
            listenerConfigurations:
                -
                  id: "default"
                  host: "0.0.0.0"
                  port: 9090
                -
                  id: "msf4j-https"
                  host: "0.0.0.0"
                  port: 9443
                  scheme: https
                  keyStoreFile: "${carbon.home}/resources/security/wso2carbon.jks"
                  keyStorePassword: wso2carbon
                  certPass: wso2carbon
            ```
    
        ![Adding a New Server]({{base_path}}/assets/img/streaming/handling-requests-with-errors/add-a-new-server.png)
        
        Then click **Add**.
        
    3. In the **Siddhi Apps to Deploy** section, select the check boxes for the **MappingErrorTest.siddhi** and **SinkTransportErrorTest.siddhi** applications. In the **Servers** section, select the check box for the server you added. Then click **Deploy**.
    
        ![Select Siddhi Application and Server]({{base_path}}/assets/img/streaming/handling-requests-with-errors/select-siddhi-app-and-server.png)
        
## Step 4: Connect the Error Store Explorer to the SI server

The Error Store Explorer is a tool that allows you to view, correct and replay events with errors. It order to use it, it needs to be connected to the SI server.

To connect the Error Store Explorer to the SI server, follow the procedure below:

1. Start the Streaming Integrator Tooling server by navigating to the `<SI_TOOLING_HOME>/bin` directory and issuing one of the following commands as appropriate, based on your operating system:
                                                 
     - For Windows: `tooling.bat`
    
     - For Linux: `./tooling.sh`
     
    Then Access the Streaming Integrator Tooling via the URL that appears in the start up log with the text `Editor Started on:`.
       
2. To open the Error Store Explorer, click **Tools** and then click **Error Store Explorer**.

    The Error Store Explorer opens as shown below. 
   
    ![Access Error Store]({{base_path}}/assets/img/streaming/handling-requests-with-errors/error-store-explorer-without-server.png)
   
3. Click **Connect to Server**. Then enter information as follows:
   To check the port of the Streaming Integrator Server, Open <SI_HOME>/conf/server/deployment.yaml file. Under Listener Configurations of wso2.transport.http, locate the listener configuration with msf4j-https as the ID and specify its port as shown in the extract below.

    ![Server Configuration]({{base_path}}/assets/img/streaming/handling-requests-with-errors/server-configurations.png)

    |**Parameter**|**Value**    |
    |-------------|-------------|
    |**Host**     | `localhost` |
    |**Port**     | `9444`      |
    |**Username** | `admin`     |
    |**Password** | `admin`     |
    
    Then click **Connect**.
        
## Step 5: Test the event mapping failing scenario

### Step 5.1: Publish an event with a mapping error in MappingErrorTest Siddhi application

Send an event to the `ProductionStream` stream of the `MappingErrorTest`' Siddhi application by issuing the following CURL command.

```
curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:8006/productionStream' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
                "foo": "Cake",
                "amount": 20.12
            }'
```
The event causes an error referred to as `MappingFailedException`. This is because the `ProductionStream` expects an event in the following format which is specified via a custom mapping.
```
{
    "name": "Cake",
    "amount": 20.12
}
```

### Step 5.2: Manage the error in the Error Store Explorer

To manage the error in the Error Store Explorer, follow the procedure below:
    
1. To open the Error Store Explorer, open Streaming Integrator Tooling, click **Tools** and then click **Error Store Explorer**.

    ![Access Error Store]({{base_path}}/assets/img/streaming/handling-requests-with-errors/access-error-store-explorer.png)
    
    The Error Store Explorer opens as shown below.
    
    ![Error Store Explorer]({{base_path}}/assets/img/streaming/handling-requests-with-errors/error-store-explorer.png)
    
    The single error displayed is the mapping error that you previously simulated.
    
2. To view details of the error, click **Detailed Info**. The following is displayed.

    ![Error Entry]({{base_path}}/assets/img/streaming/handling-requests-with-errors/error-entry.png)
    
3. You can correct the mapping and replay the event. To do this, change `foo` in the event to `name` and click `replay`.
    
    ![Replay Error]({{base_path}}/assets/img/streaming/handling-requests-with-errors/replay-error.png)
    
    As a result, the **Error Entry** dialog box closes, and the **Error Store Explorer** dialog box is displayed with no errors.
    
    At the same time the following is logged for the Streaming Integrator Server.
    
    ```
        INFO {io.siddhi.core.stream.output.sink.LogSink} - Successful mapping:  : Event{timestamp=1595574091411, data=[Cake, 20.02], isExpired=false}
    ```
   
## Step 6: Test the event failing scenario at sink level

### Step 6.1: Trigger an event flow that publishes an event to the SinkTransportErrorTest Siddhi application

Send an HTTP event to the `TestInput` stream of the `SinkTransportErrorTest` Siddhi application by issuing the following CURL command.

```
curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:8007/testUnavailableEP' --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-raw ' { "event": { "name": "Cake2", "amount": 20.222 } }'
```

The following is logged in the Streaming Integrator Server console
```
INFO {io.siddhi.core.query.processor.stream.LogStreamProcessor} - SinkTransportErrorTest: Sending to unavailableEndpoint: , StreamEvent{ timestamp=1597853565942, beforeWindowData=null, onAfterWindowData=null, outputData=[Cake2, 20.222], type=CURRENT, next=null}
```
However, because the `http://localhost:8007/testUnavailableEP` is unavailable, the event is dropped at the sink level and then stored in the ErrorStore.

### Step 6.2: Start service via the ReceiveAndCount Siddhi application

In this step, let's start the service at `http://localhost:8007/testUnavailableEP` via the `ReceiveAndCount` Siddhi application

In the **Siddhi Apps to Deploy** section, select the check box for the **ReceiveAndCount.siddhi** application. In the **Servers** section, select the check box for the server you added. Then click **Deploy**.

   ![Select ReceiveAndCount Siddhi Application and Server]({{base_path}}/assets/img/streaming/handling-requests-with-errors/select-receive-and-count-app-and-server.png)

The following log is displayed in the Streaming Integrator console.

```
INFO {org.wso2.carbon.streaming.integrator.core.internal.StreamProcessorService} - Siddhi App ReceiveAndCount deployed successfully
```
### Step 6.3: Manage the error in the Error Store Explorer

To manage the error in the Error Store Explorer, follow the procedure below:
    
1. To open the Error Store Explorer, open Streaming Integrator Tooling, click **Tools** and then click **Error Store Explorer**.

    ![Access Error Store]({{base_path}}/assets/img/streaming/handling-requests-with-errors/access-error-store-explorer.png)
    
2. In the **Siddhi app** field, select **SinkTransportErrorTest** Siddhi application and then click **Fetch**.
    
    As a result, an error is displayed as follows.
    
    ![Error Store Explorer]({{base_path}}/assets/img/streaming/handling-requests-with-errors/error-store-explorer-with-sink-transport-error-test.png)
    
    This indicates that the event was dropped because the end point was not available.
    
3. To view details of the error, click **Detailed Info**. The following is displayed.

    ![Error Entry]({{base_path}}/assets/img/streaming/handling-requests-with-errors/error-entry-for-sink-transport-error-test.png)
    
    Previously, you deployed the `ReceiveAndCount` Siddhi application. Therefore, you can send the event again by clicking **Replay**.
    
    ![Replay Error]({{base_path}}/assets/img/streaming/handling-requests-with-errors/replay-error-sink-transport-error-test.png)
    
    As a result, the **Error Entry** dialog box closes, and the **Error Store Explorer** dialog box is displayed with no errors.
    
    At the same time the following is logged for the Streaming Integrator Server which is logged by the ReceiveAndCount Siddhi application.
    
    ```
    INFO {io.siddhi.core.stream.output.sink.LogSink} - ReceiveAndCount : TotalCountStream : Event{timestamp=1597857170244, data=[1], isExpired=false}    
    ```
### Step 7: Handle events that fail at database level

#### Step 7.1: Create a MySQL database table

Create a MySQL table as follows:

1. To create a database named `production`, issue the following MySQL command.

    ```
    CREATE SCHEMA production;
    ```
    
2.To create a table in the `production` database, issue the following commands:

    ```
    use production;   
    ```

    ```
    CREATE TABLE SweetProductionTable (
        batchID int NOT NULL,
        amount double,
        factoryID int,
        PRIMARY KEY (batchID)
    );
    ```

#### Step 7.2: Deploy the StoreRdbmsError Siddhi application

In this step, let's start the service at `http://localhost:8006/insertStream` via the `StoreRdbmsError` Siddhi 
application as follows:

1. Click the **Deploy** menu and then click **Deploy to Server**. This opens the **Deploy Siddhi Apps to Server** dialog box.

2. In the **Siddhi Apps to Deploy** section, select the check box for the **StoreRdbmsError.siddhi** application. In the **Servers** section, select the check box for the server you added. Then click **Deploy**.

    ![Select StoreRdbmsError Siddhi Application and Server]({{base_path}}/assets/img/streaming/handling-requests-with-errors/select-store-rdbms-error-app-and-server.png)

    The following log is displayed in the Streaming Integrator console.
    
    ```
    INFO {org.wso2.carbon.streaming.integrator.core.internal.StreamProcessorService} - Siddhi App StoreRdbmsError deployed successfully
    ```

#### Step 7.3: Publish an event to the StoreRdbmsError Siddhi application

Send an event to the `InsertStream` input stream of the `StoreRdbmsError` Siddhi application by issuing the following CURL 
command.

`curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:8006/insertStream' --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-raw ' { "event": { "batchID": 1, "amount": 45.6, "factoryID": 102 } }'`

To check whether the published event is successfully saved in the `SweetProductionTable` table, issue the following command:

`select * from SweetProductionTable;`

The following is displayed:

![Published Event]({{base_path}}/assets/img/streaming/handling-requests-with-errors/published-event-stored-in-db.png)

Use the same curl command as above to publish another event. However, this time the event fails because the `batchID`
column that is defined as the primary key has a duplicate value of 1 in the second message. Due to this, the Siddhi application logs the following 
in the wso2si terminal. It shows that the erroneous event has been captured and stored in the error store.

```
[2020-11-03 11:48:28,951] ERROR {io.siddhi.core.table.Table} - Error on 'StoreRdbmsError' while performing add for events  at 'SweetProductionTable'. Events saved 'EventChunk{first=StreamEvent{ timestamp=1604384308930, beforeWindowData=null, onAfterWindowData=null, outputData=[1, 45.6, 102], type=CURRENT, next=null}}'
```

#### Step 7.4: Manage the error in the Error Store Explorer

To manage the error in the Error Store Explorer, follow the procedure below:

1. To open the Error Store Explorer, open Streaming Integrator Tooling, click **Tools** and then click **Error Store Explorer**.

    ![Access Error Store]({{base_path}}/assets/img/streaming/handling-requests-with-errors/access-error-store-explorer.png)

2. In the **Siddhi app** field, select **StoreRdbmsError** Siddhi application and then click **Fetch**.

    As a result, an error is displayed as follows.

    ![Error Store Explorer]({{base_path}}/assets/img/streaming/handling-requests-with-errors/error-store-explorer-with-StoreRdbmsError.png)

    This indicates that the event was dropped due to database constrained violation.

2. To view details of the error, click **Detailed Info**. The following is displayed.

    ![Error Entry]({{base_path}}/assets/img/streaming/handling-requests-with-errors/error-entry-for-StoreRdbmsError.png)

    The erroneous event is displayed as a editable table as shown below. Change the value of batchID from `1` to `2` and 
    click **Replay**.

    ![Replay Error]({{base_path}}/assets/img/streaming/handling-requests-with-errors/replay-error-StoreRdbmsError.png)

    As a result, the **Error Entry** dialog box closes, and the **Error Store Explorer** dialog box is displayed with 
    no errors.

    You can view the records in the `SweetProductionTable` to verify if the edited event has been added successfully. To do this, issue the following MySQL command.
    
    `select * from SweetProductionTable;`
    
    The following is displayed
    
    ![Corrected Event]({{base_path}}/assets/img/streaming/handling-requests-with-errors/corrected-event-stored-in-db.png)

!!! info
    The following are other types of database errors that WSO2 Streaming Integrator can capture and store in the error store so that you can correct and replay them.<br/><br/>
        - Database errors such as violation of foreign key, not null errors etc.<br/>
        - Database connection errors that can occur if the database goes down when an event is published
