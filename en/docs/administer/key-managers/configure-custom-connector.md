# Configure a Custom Key Manager

WSO2 API Manager is capable of integrating with any external OAuth Authorization Server to manage the OAuth clients and tokens that are required by WSO2 API Manager. Essentially, if the API Provider wants to expose their APIs to users who are not in the API Manager’s user-store, you need to use a custom Key Manager connector. To configure a custom Key Manager, you need to do the following:

- Write a custom Key Manager
- Deploy the custom Key Manager in API Manager
- Register the relevant Identity Provider as a Key Manager in the Admin Portal by providing the required details.
- Register and generate credentials in the external Identity Provider from the Developer Portal.

Refer to the instructions below to do the configurations.

## Step 1 - Create a Key Manager connector bundle 

You need to write a custom Key Manager connector as explained below.

!!! tip
    The following are some out-of-the-box connectors that you can use as references.
   
      - [Okta Connector](https://github.com/wso2-extensions/apim-km-okta/)
   
      - [Keycloak Connector](https://github.com/wso2-extensions/apim-keymanager-keycloak/)

      - [Azure AD Connector](https://github.com/wso2-extensions/apim-km-azure-ad/)

1. Create a Maven project.

      Let's download the sample project from [here]({{base_path}}/assets/attachments/administer/custom.auth.client.zip).
   
      However, when manually creating a Maven project, you will need to follow the following steps.

      1. Define a class that implements the `KeyManagerConnectorConfiguration` interface that is responsible for managing the configurations related to the Authorization Server. 
   
      2. Define a class that extends the `AbstractKeyManager` abstract class which is responsible for managing OAuth clients and the tokens that are needed by WSO2 API Manager.

2. Implement `KeyManagerConnectorConfiguration`.

      In the sample project, this has been implemented in the `org.wso2.custom.client.CustomOAuthClient.java` class.

      The following are the methods that the `KeyManagerConnectorConfiguration` interface uses to carry out various related operations.

     <table>
     <colgroup>
     <col width="30%" />
     <col width="70%" />
     </colgroup>
     <thead>
     <tr class="header">
     <th><b>Method</b></th>
     <th><b>Description</b></th>
     </tr>
     </thead>
     <tbody>
     <tr class="odd">
     <td><strong>getImplementation</strong></td>
     <td><p>Provides the fully qualified class name of the implementation that corresponds to the `KeyManager` interface.</p></td>
     </tr>
     <tr class="even">
     <td><strong>getJWTValidator</strong></td>
     <td><p>Provides the fully qualified class name of the implementation that corresponds to the `JWTValidator`.</p></td>
     </tr>
     <tr class="odd">
     <td><strong>getConnectionConfigurations</strong></td>
     <td><p>Provides the list of configurations that need to appear in the Admin Portal in order to connect with the Key Manager.</p></td>
     </tr>
     <tr class="even">
     <td><strong>getApplicationConfigurations</strong></td>
     <td><p>Provides the list of configurations that are needed to create OAuth applications in the OAuth server in the Developer Portal.
     </p></td>
     </tr>
     <tr class="odd">
     <td><strong>getType</strong></td>
     <td><p>Type of connector. For example, Okta.</p></td>
     </tr>
     <tr class="even">
     <td><strong>getDisplayName</strong></td>
     <td><p>Display name to show in the Admin Portal.</p></td>
     </tr>
     <tr class="odd">
     <td><strong>getDefaultScopesClaim</strong></td>
     <td><p>The default scope claim available in JWT if it is different than the <b>scope</b>.</p></td>
     </tr>
     <tr class="even">
     <td><strong>getDefaultConsumerKeyClaim</strong></td>
     <td><p>The default consumer key claim available in JWT if it is different to <b>azp</b>, which is the Authorized party - the party to which the ID token was issued.</p></td>
     </tr>
     </tbody>
     </table>  
  
3. Extend `AbstractKeyManager`.

      The `AbstractKeyManager` implements the `KeyManager` interface. For more information on the operations carried out on the `KeyManager` interface, see [Extending the Key Manager Interface]({{base_path}}/develop/extending-api-manager/extending-key-management/extending-the-key-manager-interface).


      In the sample project, the `AbstractKeyManager` interface has been extended using the `org.wso2.custom.client.CustomOAuthClient.java` class.

4. If you need to customize the `JWTValidation` interface, you need to [extend the JWTValidator]({{base_path}}/develop/extending-api-manager/extending-key-management/extending-key-validation).

5. Build the project.

      Navigate to the `<PROJECT_HOME>` directory and execute the following command.
      
      `mvn clean install`

      This will create a custom Key Manager connector JAR.
     
## Step 2 - Deploy the bundle in the WSO2 API-M Server

1. Stop the API-M server if it is already running. 

2. Copy the JAR file that is generated in the `custom.key.manager` component target directory, and add it in to the `<API-M Server>/repository/components/dropins/` directory.

3. Start the Server

## Step 3 - Configure the connector using the Admin Portal

When registering a third-party Identity Provider as a Key Manager in the Admin Portal, you need to select the method with which the APIs are invoked. The two types of token invocation methods are as follows:

- **Direct tokens**: These tokens are issued by the third-party Identity Provider and are invoked when authentication happens.

- **Exchange tokens**: These tokens are issued by the Identity Provider and are exchanged with WSO2 API Manager. These are then used when authentication happens.

??? note "Click here for more details on the Token Exchange API invocation method"
    The authentication process is based on OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange Grant Type. This is used to exchange an external Identity Provider’s token for the Resident Key Manager's token available in WSO2 API Manager. 

    With this approach, a user should be able to:

    * Create an application in the Developer Portal.
    * Generate keys by selecting the Token Exchange grant type.
    * Get an API Manager token by invoking the token endpoint of API Manager with the required parameters (i.e., the token obtained from the external Identity Provider)
    * Invoke the API with the exchanged token

    !!! note
        When configuring an external Key Manager with only the Token Exchange invocation method, ensure that the Resident Key Manager has the Token Exchange grant type enabled.


1. Sign in to the Admin Portal using the following URL: `https://<hostname>:9443/admin`

    !!! tip
          For example, this URL can be `https://localhost:9443/admin` and you can use `admin` as the username and password to access the Admin Portal.

2. Add a new Key Manager.

     1. Click **Key Managers** and then click **Add Key Manager**.

          [![Add new Key Manager]({{base_path}}/assets/img/administer/add-key-manager.png)]({{base_path}}/assets/img/administer/add-key-manager.png)

     2. Add the Key Manager configurations in the form that appears. The following tables provide definitions for each of the Key Manager configurations.


          **General Details** - This section of the form includes the basic information of the Key Manager.

## Step 4 - Generate the keys using the custom Key Manager

1. Sign in to the Developer Portal using the following URL: `https://<hostname>:9443/devportal`

    !!! tip
          This can be `https://localhost:9443/devportal` and you can use “admin” as the username and password to access the Developer Portal.

2. Click **Applications**.

3. Create a new application or use the default application.

4. Select the Key Manager.

      - If you select the **Direct Token** radio button, you see the following screen:

        You need to generate and provide the token of the external Key Manager you are using here.

5. Click **Generate Keys** or **Generate Access Token**.

    !!! tip
        If you want to generate the tokens with scopes, make sure that those scopes are defined in the Authorization Server.

6. You can now use the generated token to [invoke an API]({{base_path}}/consume/invoke-apis/invoke-apis-using-tools/invoke-apis-using-tools/invoke-an-api-using-the-integrated-api-console).
