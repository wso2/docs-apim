# Configure a Azure AD as a Key Manager

WSO2 API Manager supports multiple Key Managers. As a result, WSO2 API Manager is prepacked with an inbuilt resident Key Manager and with the use of connectors it is capable of supporting any authorization server as a Key Manager.

Therefore, WSO2 API Manager can connect Azure AD out-of-the-box using the [WSO2 API-M KM Azure AD Connector](https://github.com/wso2-extensions/apim-km-azure-ad/).

Follow the instructions given below to configure AzureAD as a third-party Key Manager.

!!! info
For more information, see the [Getting Started Guide, which is under the official Azure Entra ID documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/).

## Configure AzureAD

1. Create An Azure account that has an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
2. The Azure account must have permission to manage applications in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). Any of the following Azure AD roles include the required permissions:

   - Application administrator
   - Application developer
   - Cloud application administrator

This will complete the [Set up a tenant](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-create-new-tenant) quickstart.

### Step 1 - Create Application

1. Visit [Azure Home](https://portal.azure.com/#home).
2. Navigate to [Microsoft Entra ID](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/~/Overview).
3. Navigate to [App Registration](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/~/RegisteredApps).
4. Navigate to New registration, Give a name `(Ex : KeyManger Client)` and Click Register.

### Step 2 - Create secrets

1. Navigate to `Certificates & secrets`>`Client secrets`>`New client secret`.
2. Fill the form with relevant information and give `Custom` as the value for Expire.
3. Make sure to copy the secret, it only shows once.

### Step 3 - Configured permissions

1. Navigate to `API Permissions`.
2. Click `Add a permission`.
3. Select `APIs my organization uses`.
4. Select `Microsoft Graph` from the list.
5. Click on `Application permissions`.
6. Expand `Application` and check
   - Application.Read.All
   - Application.ReadWrite.All
   - Application.ReadWrite.OwnedBy
7. Click `Add permissions`.
8. Click `Grant admin consent for Default Directory`.

Ensure that the newly added permissions display a green checkmark to indicate successful configuration.

### Step 4 - Copy Application Details

1. Navigate to [Microsoft Entra ID](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/~/Overview).
2. Click on 'Endpoints' and Note down
   - OAuth 2.0 token endpoint (v2.0)
     </br>e.g. `https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant-id}/oauth2/v2.0/token`
   - OpenID Connect metadata document (v2.0)
     </br>e.g. `https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant-id}/v2.0/.well-known/openid-configuration`
   - Microsoft Graph API endpoint
     </br>e.g. `https://graph.microsoft.com`
3. Under `Owned applications` click on the newly created application.
4. Copy the Application (client) ID.

## Configure API manager

Start the API Manager server and log-in to the Admin portal to configure Azure AD as a Key Manager.

### Step 1 - Configure Key Manager

1. Click on `Key Managers` from the side panel and then click `Add Key Manager`.
2. Fill the following


    - Name: `AzureAD`
    - Display Name: `Azure AD Key Manager`

4. Fill the Consumer Key Claim URI: `appid` in the `Claim URIs` section.
5. Set the Grant Types: `client_credentials` (Only use this grant type).
6. Provide the relevant details in the `Connector Configurations` section.

7. Set the **Permissions**:


    - **Key Manager Permission**: Permission type for role-based Key Manager restriction.
      e.g., `PUBLIC`, `ALLOW`, `DENY` (Optional)

8.  Click on `Add`.

### Step 2 - Create an Application & Generate Keys

1.  Click on `Add New Application`.
2.  Fill the required information and click on `Add`.
3.  Once created, navigate to the `Production Keys` section of that Application.
4.  Select the `Azure AD Key Manager` and click on `Generate Keys`.

!!! note "Troubleshooting Invalid Credentials Error"
If you encounter the following error message when using a token generated by the Key Manager to invoke an API deployed in APIM:
`bash
    {
      "code": "900901",
      "message": "Invalid Credentials",
      "description": "Access failure for API: /exampleapi/1.0.0, version: 1.0.0 status: (900901) - Invalid Credentials. Make sure you have provided the correct security credentials."
    }
    `
Please verify that the `iss` (issuer) claim in the token matches the issuer configured in the Key Manager Endpoints section. If there is a difference, update the issuer in the Key Manager Endpoints section to align with the `iss` value present in the token.

### Post checks

Under [App registration](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/~/RegisteredApps) there should be a newly created application. The value should be

         `api://<Application (client) ID>`


We can also get this value by clicking the `set` link right next to the label. Default value is what we will see above.

Without this in the app, the token will be generate in a version 1 format and will not work with APIM KM due to failed signature.

### Update the client_password

Update password is not supported by providing new one from the APIM. Whenever the application is updated via APIM a new `client_secret` is set.

`Failed to add password. Error detail: Unable to save changes because the credential limit has been reached. Please delete a credential and try again.`

If you see this message in logs or while updating the application several times, The issue is with limitation with Azure AD `client_secret`. At a given application max number of client_secrets can have is 2. Delete old one from AzureAD console web client.

### Adding existing key with APIM

With the limitation on getting generated `client_secrets` after its generated, it not support to add existing keys from APIM.
