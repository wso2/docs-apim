# Integrating with Google Analytics

You can configure the API Manager to track runtime statistics of API invocations through [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics). Google Analytics is a service that allows you to track visits to a website and generate detailed statistics on them.

This guide explains how to setup API Manager in order to feed runtime statistics to Google analytics for summarization and display.

1.  Setup a Google Analytics account if not subscribed already and receive a Tracking ID, which is of the format "UA-XXXXXXXX-X". A Tracking ID is issued at the time an account is created with Google Analytics.
2.  Log in to the API Manager management console (`https://localhost:9443/carbon`) using admin/admin credentials and go to **Main -&gt; Resources -&gt; Browse** menu.

3.  Navigate to /_system/governance/apimgt/statistics/ga-config.xml file.

4.  Change the &lt;Enabled&gt; element to `true` , set your tracking ID in &lt;TrackingID&gt; element and **Save**.

5.  If you want to enable tracking for tenants, log in to the management console with a tenant's credentials, click **Source View**, and then add the following parameter to the `org.wso2.carbon.mediation.registry.WSO2Registry` registry definition near the top (repeat this step for each tenant):

    `<parameter name="cachableDuration">15000</parameter>`

    The following screen shot illustrates this change:

6.  API Manager is now integrated with Google Analytics. A user who has subscribed to a published API through the API Store should see an icon as `Real-Time` after logging into their Google Analytics account. Click on this icon and select **Overview**.

7.  Invoke the above API using the embedded [WSO2 REST Client](../../../Learn/ConsumeAPI/InvokeApis/InvokeApisUsingTools/invoke-an-api-using-the-integrated-api-console/)(or any third-part rest client such as cURL).

    #### Real-time statistics

8.  This is one invocation of the API. Accordingly, Google Analytics graphs and statistics will be displayed at runtime. This example displays the **PageViews** per second graph and 1 user as active.

    #### Report statistics

    Google analytics reporting statistics take more than 24 hours from the time of invocation to populate. Shown below is a sample Dashboard with populated statistics.

    There are widgets with statistics related to Audience, Traffic, Page Content, Visit Duration etc. You can add any widget of your preference to dashboard.
