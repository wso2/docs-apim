# Configuring APIM Analytics

This section explains how to configure analytics for WSO2 API Manager (WSO2 API-M). The API Manager integrates with the [WSO2 Streaming Integrator](https://wso2.com/integration/streaming-integrator) to provide reports, statistics and graphs on the APIs deployed in WSO2 API Manager. You can then configure alerts to monitor these APIs and detect unusual activity, manage locations via geo location statistics and carry out detailed analysis of the logs. WSO2 API Manager has an enhanced distribution of Analytics to cater to API Manager specific scenarios which is used here to configure APIM Analytics.

Please refer the  [**Quick Setup**](#quick-setup) section to set up analytics for quick demos and try-out scenarios, or refer the [**Standard Setup**](#standard-setup) section to set up analytics for a production environment.

!!! note
      -   WSO2 recommends using the API-M Analytics (powered by [WSO2 Streaming Integrator](https://wso2.com/integration/streaming-integrator) ) distribution to set up the minimum high availability deployment with API Manager. For configuration details, see [Minimum High Availability Deployment for Streaming Integrator](https://ei.docs.wso2.com/en/next/streaming-integrator/setup/deploying-si-as-minimum-ha-cluster/) .
      -   It is not recommended to configure the Gateway node as an analytics server.

       <p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
       <p>If you are following the quick setup make sure both the binaries ( unzipped API-M pack and unzipped Analytics pack) are inside the same directory. 
                        Because the default configurations such as database connection urls etc are configured assuming that both the packs are inside the same folder.
                        </p>

       </div>
       </html>
                  
3.  To enable Analytics, open the `<API-M_HOME>/repository/conf/deployment.toml` file and uncomment the analytics enabling section as shown below. Save this change.

    ``` toml
        [apim.analytics]
        enable = true
    ```

    !!! note
          If you are working on a distributed (clustered) setup of WSO2 API Manager, do the configurations instructed to be done in API Manager in the Publisher, Store, and Gateway nodes as well.


4.  Start the Worker profile of the Analytics Server.
    <br/>Navigate to the `<API-M_ANALYTICS_HOME>/bin` directory in your console and execute one of the following scripts based on your OS.
    -   On Windows: `worker.bat --run              `
    -   On Linux/Mac OS: `sh worker.sh               `

5.  Start the API Manager server.
    <br/>Navigate to the `<API-M_HOME>/bin` directory in your console and execute one of the following scripts based on your OS.
    -   On Windows: `wso2server.bat --run`
    -   On Linux/Mac OS: `sh wso2server.sh` 
    
        !!! info
                  If API-M Analytics is properly configured in WSO2 API Manager, when you start up the API Manager server, which is after the WSO2 API-M Analytics server, you will see the following log message in the terminal that is running the API-M Analytics server.
            
                    INFO {org.wso2.carbon.databridge.core.DataBridge} - user admin connected   
                    
6.  Start the Dashboard profile of the Analytics Server.
    <br/>Navigate to the `<API-M_ANALYTICS_HOME>/bin` directory in your console and execute one of the following scripts based on your OS.
    -   On Windows: `dashboard.bat --run`  
    -   On Linux/Mac OS: `sh dashboard.sh`    
    
    

7.  Optionally, if you wish to access the business rules via the Dashboard node, you can use the dashboard profile that we started in the previous step.            

You can now start using the WSO2 API Manager for its usual operations and the required Analytics functionality.

 <br/>For more information on installing WSO2 API-M, see the [Installation Guide](../../InstallAndSetup/InstallationGuide/installation-prerequisites.md) .
    
 ![](../../assets/img/Learn/apim-download-page.png)
    
#### Step 2 - Download and install WSO2 API-M Analytics

To download WSO2 API-M Analytics go to the [WSO2 API Manager page](https://wso2.com/api-management/install/), click **Download** to expand the installation options.Navigate to the **Other Resources** section, and click **Analytics**. 
<br/>As the process of installing API-M Analytics is identical to installing WSO2 Streaming Integrator 1.0.0 (WSO2 SI), for more information you can refer to the [WSO2 SI documentation](#https://ei.docs.wso2.com/en/next/streaming-integrator/setup/installing-si-in-vm/).

  ![](../../assets/img/Learn/analytics-download-page.png)
    
#### Step 3 - Configure WSO2 API Manager to publish statistics

Follow the instructions below to do the required configurations for WSO2 API-M to publish statistics in the WSO2 API-M Analytics server.

!!! warning
      If you are working on a distributed (clustered) setup of API Manager, carryout the instructed configurations in the Publisher, Store and Gateway nodes of the API Manager.

Open the `<API-M_HOME>/repository/conf/deployment.toml` file and uncomment the following section as shown below. Save this change.

   ``` toml
       [apim.analytics]
       enable = true
   ```
Configure the following parameters under the `[apim.analytics]` section if required.

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Parameter</th>
<th>Value</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td width="10%"><code>receiver_urls</code></td>
<td width="30%">
<code>
&lt;protocol&gt;://&lt;hostname&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/
</code>
</td>
<td>
The server URL of the remote WSO2 API-M Analytics server used to collect statistics from WSO2 API Manager. Use this configuration if there is only one group with either one or many receivers.
<p> e.g., Three receivers within a single group can be specified as follows.
<br/><code>receiver_urls = tcp://localhost:7612,tcp://localhost:7613,tcp://localhost:7614</code>
</p>
<html><div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">From DAS to SI</p>
<p>
Previously, when WSO2 API-M Analytics was powered by WSO2 Data Analytics Server 3.1.0, you had to add a comma to separate the DAS URLs so that the analytics events were published to both nodes. 
However, when using WSO2 API-M Analytics 3.0.0, which is based on WSO2 Streaming Integrator 1.0.0, when publishing to an HA setup of APIM analytics, you need to separate the Receiver URLs by the pipe symbol (|) because the analytics events are published in a failover manner where only one node handles the processing at any given time.
<br/>e.g.,
<br/><code>receiver_urls = "tcp://localhost:7612 | tcp://localhost:7613"</code>
</p>
</div>
</html>
</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><code>[[apim.analytics.url_group]]
<br/>analytics_url</code></td>
<td><code>&lt;protocol&gt;://&lt;hostname&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/</code></td>
<td>
An event can also be published to multiple receiver groups, where each group has one or more receivers. 
For each receiver groups we need to repeat the above section, whereas receivers are delimited by commas.
<p>
e.g., Two receiver groups with two load balanced receivers in each can be specified as follows.
<br />
<code>
<br/>[[apim.analytics.url_group]]
<br/>analytics_url =["tcp://localhost:7612","tcp://localhost:7613"]
<br/>type = "loadbalance"
<br/>
<br />[[apim.analytics.url_group]]
<br />analytics_url =["tcp://localhost:7712","tcp://localhost:7713"]
<br/>type = "loadbalance"
</code>
<br/>If the type is not specified it defaults to the fail over.

<td><div class="content-wrapper">
<p>The administrator user name to log into the remote WSO2 API-M Analytics server that collects statistics from WSO2 API Manager.</p>
<p>If you enable email user, you need to configure <code>@carbon.super</code> to the username of the API-M Analytics admin user. 
<br/>e.g., If the username of the API-M Analytics admin user is <code>demo@wso2.com</code>, it must be <code>demo@wso2.com@carbon.super</code> once you have enabled email user.</li>

   [apim.analytics].
   <br/>
   <br/>The default value <code>$ref{super_admin.username}</code> and <code>$ref{super_admin.password}</code>

Save the changes.

#### Step 4 - Configure databases

Configuring databases allow you to persist data relating to APIs, process them and analyze. Follow the procedure below to configure databases. 

1.  Stop the WSO2 API-M Analytics server if it is running already.
2.  Configure the dashboard profile.
    1. Open the `<API-M_ANALYTICS_HOME>/conf/dashboard/deployment.yaml` file.
    2. Edit the `APIM_ANALYTICS_DB` and `AM_DB` sections and point to your desired type of database. 
       <br/>A sample for MySQL is shown below.
       
         ``` java
           - name: AM_DB
               description: Main datasource used by API Manager
               jndiConfig:
                 name: jdbc/AM_DB
               definition:
                 type: RDBMS
                 configuration:
                   jdbcUrl: "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/am_db"
                   username: wso2carbon
                   password: wso2carbon
                   driverClassName: com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
                   maxPoolSize: 10
                   idleTimeout: 60000
                   connectionTestQuery: SELECT 1
                   validationTimeout: 30000
                   isAutoCommit: false

         ```
    
3.  Configure the worker profile. 
    
      1. Open the `<API-M_ANALYTICS_HOME>/conf/worker/deployment.yaml` file 
      2. Edit the `APIM_ANALYTICS_DB` section. 
       <br/>A sample for MySQL is shown below.

          ``` java
            - name: APIM_ANALYTICS_DB
                 description: "The datasource used for APIM statistics aggregated data."
                 jndiConfig:
                   name: jdbc/APIM_ANALYTICS_DB
                 definition:
                   type: RDBMS
                   configuration:
                     jdbcUrl: 'jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/stats_db'
                     username: 'root'
                     password: '123'
                     driverClassName: com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
                     maxPoolSize: 50
                     idleTimeout: 60000
                  connectionTestQuery: SELECT 1
                  validationTimeout: 30000
                  isAutoCommit: false
          ```
         
    !!! Info
          If your deployment does not consist of any Microgateways, you do not need to configure the WSO2AM_MGW_ANALYTICS_DB to an external database as you can use the default embedded H2 database.

      3. Configure `WSO2AM_MGW_ANALYTICS_DB` to the same database as `APIM_ANALYTICS_DB` in the `<API-M_ANALYTICS_HOME>/conf/worker/deployment.yaml` file.
         
         ``` java
           - name: WSO2AM_MGW_ANALYTICS_DB
               description: "The datasource used for APIM MGW analytics data."
               jndiConfig:
                 name: jdbc/WSO2AM_MGW_ANALYTICS_DB
               definition:
                 type: RDBMS
                 configuration:
                   jdbcUrl: 'jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/stats_db'
                   username: 'root'
                   password: '123'
                   driverClassName: com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
                 maxPoolSize: 50
                 idleTimeout: 60000
                 connectionTestQuery: SELECT 1
                 validationTimeout: 30000
                 isAutoCommit: false
         ```
         
      4. Create the AM_USAGE_UPLOADED_FILES table in the APIM_ANALYTICS_DB database. 
      
         ```tab="MySQL"
            CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS AM_USAGE_UPLOADED_FILES (
            FILE_NAME varchar(255) NOT NULL,
            FILE_TIMESTAMP TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
            FILE_PROCESSED tinyint(1) DEFAULT 0,
            FILE_CONTENT MEDIUMBLOB DEFAULT NULL,
            PRIMARY KEY (FILE_NAME, FILE_TIMESTAMP)
            );
               
         ```
         
         ```tab="MSSQL"
            CREATE TABLE AM_USAGE_UPLOADED_FILES (
            FILE_NAME varchar(255) NOT NULL,
            FILE_TIMESTAMP DATETIME2(0) DEFAULT GETDATE(),
            FILE_PROCESSED smallint DEFAULT 0,
            FILE_CONTENT VARBINARY(max) DEFAULT NULL,
            PRIMARY KEY (FILE_NAME, FILE_TIMESTAMP)
            );
         ```
         
         ```tab="Oracle"
            CREATE TABLE AM_USAGE_UPLOADED_FILES (
            FILE_NAME varchar2(255) NOT NULL,
            FILE_TIMESTAMP TIMESTAMP(0) DEFAULT SYSTIMESTAMP,
            FILE_PROCESSED number(3) DEFAULT 0,
            FILE_CONTENT BLOB DEFAULT NULL,
            PRIMARY KEY (FILE_NAME, FILE_TIMESTAMP)
            );
         ```
         
         ```tab="Postgres"
            CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS AM_USAGE_UPLOADED_FILES (
            FILE_NAME varchar(255) NOT NULL,
            FILE_TIMESTAMP TIMESTAMP(0) DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
            FILE_PROCESSED smallint DEFAULT 0,
            FILE_CONTENT BYTEA DEFAULT NULL,
            PRIMARY KEY (FILE_NAME, FILE_TIMESTAMP)
            );
         ```
         
         ```tab="DB2"
            CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS AM_USAGE_UPLOADED_FILES (
            FILE_NAME varchar(255) NOT NULL,
            FILE_TIMESTAMP TIMESTAMP(0) DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
            FILE_PROCESSED tinyint DEFAULT 0,
            FILE_CONTENT MEDIUMBLOB DEFAULT NULL,
            PRIMARY KEY (FILE_NAME, FILE_TIMESTAMP)
            );
         ```
         
         ```tab="Informix"
            CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS AM_USAGE_UPLOADED_FILES (
            FILE_NAME varchar(255) NOT NULL,
            FILE_TIMESTAMP TIMESTAMP(0) DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
            FILE_PROCESSED tinyint DEFAULT 0,
            FILE_CONTENT MEDIUMBLOB DEFAULT NULL,
            PRIMARY KEY (FILE_NAME, FILE_TIMESTAMP)
            );
         ```
   
       
4.  Point the following data sources to external databases. 
       None of the following databases need DB scripts. The tables will be automatically created.
      1. WSO2_DASHBOARD_DB (dashboard profile)
      2. BUSINESS_RULES_DB (dashboard profile)
      3. WSO2_PERMISSIONS_DB (worker + dashboard)
      4. GEO_LOCATION_DATA (Only if you need geo-location based statistics.)
5.  Start the WSO2 API-M Analytics server.

!!! Info
      **Do the following to integrate third party products when configuring databases.**
      <br/>WSO2 SI is a OSGi-based product. Therefore, when you integrate third party products such as Oracle with WSO2 API-M Analytics, you need to check whether the libraries you need to add are OSGi based. If they are not, you need to convert them to OSGi bundles before adding them to the `<API-M_ANALYTICS_HOME>/lib` directory.
      To convert the jar files to OSGi bundles, follow the steps below.
      <br/>  1. Download the non-OSGi jar for the required third party product, and save it in a preferred directory in your machine.
      <br/>  2. Go to the `<API-M_ANALYTICS_HOME>/bin` directory. Run the command given below, to generate the converted file in the `<API-M_ANALYTICS_HOME>/lib` directory.
        
      ``` java
          ./jartobundle.sh <PATH_TO_NON-OSGi_JAR> ../lib
      ```

#### Step 5 - Configure APIM IdP Cleint

APIM IdP Client authenticates users by interacting with the identity provider of API Manager via OAuth2. The APIM Manager user store is used to provide the access to APIM Analytics as well. WSO2 APIM Analytics server authenticates by requesting an access token from the identity provider in API Manager using the authentication code grant type. This APIM IdP client enables SSO(Single Sign On). 

Furthermore, APIM IdP client functionality can be controlled via the properties defined in the <APIM_ANALYTICS_HOME>/conf/dashboard/deployment.yaml file under the auth.configs namespace as shown below.

```
auth.configs:
  type: apim
  ssoEnabled: true
  properties:
    adminScope: apim_analytics:admin_carbon.super
    allScopes: apim_analytics:admin apim_analytics:product_manager apim_analytics:api_developer apim_analytics:app_developer apim_analytics:devops_engineer apim_analytics:analytics_viewer apim_analytics:everyone openid apim:api_view apim:subscribe

#### Step 6 - Configure keystores

In the SSL handshake between the API Manager and API Manager Analytics servers, the client (i.e. API Manager) needs to verify the certificate presented by the server (i.e. API Manager Analytics). For this purpose, the client stores the trusted certificate of the server in the `client-truststore.jks` keystore.

If you use a custom keystore in API Manager and/or API Manager Analytics, import the public key certificate of API Manager Analytics into the `client-truststore.jks` file of the API Manager. To export the public key from the server and import it into the client's trust store, follow the steps given in [Adding CA-signed certificates to keystores](../../../Administer/ProductSecurity/General/UsingAsymmetricEncryption/admin-creating-new-keystores/#step-1-generating-a-ca-signed-certificate) in the Administration Guide.
