# Viewing API Statistics

API statistics are provided for both the API Publisher and the Developer Portal. 

From API-M Analytics 3.0.0 release onwards, Publisher and Developer Portal statistics are moved out from the Publisher and Developer portal apps.
And those can be viewed using the **dashboard** runtime of the API-M Analytics server.

For instructions on how to set up Analytics, see [Configuring APIM Analytics](../configuring-apim-analytics.md) . 
Once Analytics is set up, follow the instructions below to view statistics relevant to API Publisher and Developer Portal.

First, [invoke a few APIs](../../../ConsumeAPI/InvokeApis/InvokeApisUsingTools/invoke-an-api-using-the-integrated-api-console/) to generate traffic and see the statistics.

!!! note
      The following widgets on the API Manager statistical dashboards, display real runtime statistics even when Analytics is not set up (as described in [Configuring APIM Analytics](_Configuring_APIM_Analytics_) ).
