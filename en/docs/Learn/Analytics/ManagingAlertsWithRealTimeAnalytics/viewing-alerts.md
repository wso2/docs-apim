The following procedure to view alerts is relevant only for system administrators. System administrators, API publishers as well as API subscribers receive alerts via notification emails if they have subscribed to one or more alert type.

1.  Access the WSO2 API Manager Admin Portal by using the following URL, and log in using your credentials.
    `          https://<API-M_HOST>:<API-M_port>/admin                                                  `
2.  Once the Admin Portal opens, click the following icon in the top right corner of the view.
