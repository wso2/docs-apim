# Managing Endpoint Certificates

If your api backend is secured with a self-signed certificate (or a certificate which is not signed by a CA) you need to
 import the backend certificate to the api manager (gateway) client-truststore and restart the server. This feature
  enables you to upload the backend certificate through API Publisher while creating or editing your API **without
   restarting the server**. Follow the steps below to add a certificate to an endpoint.

### Configuration (Optional)

1.  The configurations for the Endpoint Certificates can be modified by adding following config elements to the 
 `<API-M_HOME>/repository/conf/deployment.toml` file as shown below. 
    ``` toml
        [transport.passthru_https.sender.ssl_profile]
        interval = 600000
    ```
    
    | Configuration Parameter        | Description|
    |-------------|---------------------------------------------------|
    | interval    | The time taken to load the newly added certificate in ***milliseconds***. Default 10 mins. (600000ms) Minimum interval : 60000ms (1 min)|

2.  If you use a different Trust Store/ Keystore configuration for `[transport.passthru_https.sender]` in `deployment.toml` file, modify the KeyStore and TrustStore location in
`<API-M_HOME>/repository/resources/security/sslprofiles.xml` file accordingly.  The `sslprofiles.xml` file is configured with the default client-truststore.jks

          <p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
          <p>
            This feature currently supports only the following keystore and certificate types.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Keystore : `.jks`</li>
            <li>Certificate : `.crt`</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If you need to use a certificate in any other format, you can convert it to `.crt/ .cert` using a standard
             tool before uploading.
          </p>

          <p>
            The certificate will be added to the Gateway nodes which are defined under the
             `[[apim.gateway.environment]]` in `deployment.toml` . 
             In a clustered setup, since gateway configurations are identical, sync the
             `[API-M_HOME]/repository/resources/security/sslprofiles.xml` and `[API-M_HOME]/repository/resources/security/client-truststore.jks` among the gateway nodes in the cluster. After the configured interval, the
              synapse transport will be reloaded in all the gateway nodes.
