# High Availability for Endpoints

### Configuring Load Balancing Endpoints

WSO2 API Manager provides configuring load balancing endpoints through the API Publisher.

1. When you [creating an API]({{base_path}}/Learn/DesignAPI/CreateAPI/create-a-rest-api), to configure load balancing endpoints go to the edit view of the API and navigate to the **Endpoint** tab and  expand the **Load balance and Failover Configurations.**

2. Select the **Load Balanced** from the endpoint type drop-down.

Following are the other configurations that you need to do in order to specify a load balancing endpoint.
<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="30%" />
<col width="70%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Production Endpoints</td>
<td><div class="content-wrapper">
<p>The set of production endpoints can be specified here where the requests need to be load balanced. You can specify more than one endpoint by clicking on <strong>&quot;+&quot;</strong> sign and can delete the endpoints by clicking on <strong>bin</strong> icon once you added an endpoint.</p>
</div></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Sandbox endpoints</td>
<td>The set of sandbox endpoints can be specified here where te requests need to be load balanced. You can specify more than one endpoint by clicking on <strong>&quot;+&quot;</strong> sign and can delete the endpoints by clicking on <strong>bin</strong> icon.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Algorithm</td>
<td><div class="content-wrapper">
<p>The load balancing algorithm is specified here.</p>
<p>Click on the cogwheel icon to setting up algorithm</p>
<p>The default is <strong>Round Robin</strong> Algorithm which has the className of <a href="https://synapse.apache.org/apidocs/org/apache/synapse/endpoints/algorithms/RoundRobin.html">org.apache.synapse.endpoints.algorithms.RoundRobin</a> <a href="https://synapse.apache.org/apidocs/org/apache/synapse/endpoints/algorithms/RoundRobin.html">.</a> If you select other from the dropdown list of Algorithms you need to specify the class name of the algorithm. Class names of other algorithms can be found <a href="https://synapse.apache.org/apidocs/org/apache/synapse/endpoints/algorithms/package-summary.html">here</a> .</p>
<p></p>
</div></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Session Management</td>
<td>
<p>Click on the cogwheel icon to setting up session management</p>
<p>A session management method from the load balancing group. The possible values are as follows.</p>
<p><strong>None</strong> - If this is selected, session management is not used.</p>
<p><strong>Transport</strong> - If this is selected, session management is done on the transport level using HTTP cookies.</p>
<p><strong>SOAP</strong> - If this is selected, session management is done using SOAP sessions.</p>
<p><strong>Client ID</strong> - If this is selected, session management is done using an ID sent by the client.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Session Timeout</td>
<td>The number of milliseconds after which the session would time out.
<p>Click on the cogwheel icon to setting up session timeout</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

3. After completing the configuration click on **save.**

### Configuring Failover Group of Endpoints
WSO2 API Manager provides configuring failover group endpoints through the API Publisher.

1. When you [creating an API]({{base_path}}/Learn/DesignAPI/CreateAPI/create-a-rest-api), To configure failover endpoints go to the edit view of the API and navigate to the **Endpoint** tab and click **Failover** under endpoint type by expanding **Load balance and Failover Configurations.**

2. At least one failover endpoint needs to be added for production and sandbox (if you have specified)Â Endpoints.You can specify more than one endpoint by clicking on **"+"** sign and can delete the endpoints by clicking on **bin** icon.

3. After completing the adding endpoints, click on **save.**
