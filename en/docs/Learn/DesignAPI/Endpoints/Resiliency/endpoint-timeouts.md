# Endpoint Timeouts

WSO2 API Manager provides controlling the production and sandbox endpoints with the Advanced Endpoint Configuration.

To configure your endpoints with this feature, click on an API in the API Publisher listing page, navigate to the
 **Endpoints** tab and click the cogwheel icon next to the endpoint you want to configure.

The Advanced Endpoint Configuration dialog box appears as below.

Following are the configurations that we can do with the Advanced Endpoint Configurations. You can do advanced configurations for both production and sandbox endpoints.

                    <p>If you want to configure the suspension of an endpoint specifying error codes, maximum suspension time, suspension factors etc., you can use the endpoint suspension state in the Advanced Endpoint Configuration.</p>
                    <p><strong>Error Codes:</strong> Error codes which need to make the endpoint suspended. If the
                     selected error codes are received from the backend endpoint, the endpoint will be marked as
                      suspended. Specify the [transport error codes](../../../../Troubleshooting/error-handling.md) where the endpoint suspension should be
                      triggered. You can select single or multiple error codes here.</p>
                    <p><strong>Initial duration:</strong> The time duration for which the endpoint will be suspended, when one or more suspend error codes are received from the endpoint for the first time.</p>

                              <p>When creating (or updating) Failover endpoints through the Publisher UI, you need to go into this configuration box of each endpoint and specify a set of Error Codes for the endpoint to fail over on and take off the Initial Duration by setting its value to -1.</p>
