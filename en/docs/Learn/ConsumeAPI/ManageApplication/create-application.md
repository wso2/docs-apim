# Create Application

#### Overview

An application is a logical representation of an physical application such as mobile app, webapp, device etc. If an 
application to consume an API, it should subscribe to the required API over a 
selected 
business 
plan, which determined the usage quota the application is allowed to have. A single application can 
have 
multiple 
API subscriptions. Each application 
has consumer key 
and 
consumer secret pair and the requests to the subscribed APIs are authenticated via the tokens generated using them. 

Applications allow you to:

-   Generate and use a single key for multiple APIs
-   Subscribe multiple times to a single API with different Service Level Agreements (SLAs)/business plans which 
operate on per access token basis



The API Manager comes with a pre-created default application, which allows unlimited access by default. You can also 
[create](create-application.md####Create Applications) your own.
