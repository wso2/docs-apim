# Viewing Cloud Native Observability Dashboards

Let's use the **dashboards** from the cloud-native observability deployment to monitor **statistics** from your integration artifacts.

## Before you begin

Set up the suitable cloud-native observability deployment. The dashboards described in this section applies to all the cloud-native deployment strategies.

See the following topics for information and instructions:

-	Learn about the [observability deployment strategy]({{base_path}}/install-and-setup/setup/mi-setup/observability/observability-deployment-strategy).
-	Setting up [cloud-native observability for a VM environment]({{base_path}}/install-and-setup/setup/mi-setup/observability/setting-up-minimum-basic-observability-deployment).
-	Setting up [cloud-native observability for a Kubernetes environment]({{base_path}}/install-and-setup/setup/mi-setup/observability/setting-up-cloud-native-observability-in-kubernetes).

## Cluster dashboard

Cluster dashboards visualize the overall statistics relating to your Micro Integrator cluster. We can view information related to our MI cluster.

### Downloading the dashboard

You can download the dashboard from the [Grafana Labs - WSO2 Integration Cluster Metrics](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/12783).

For instructions to set up this dashboard, see [Setting Up the Cloud Native Observability Deployment]({{base_path}}/install-and-setup/setup/mi-setup/observability/setting-up-minimum-basic-observability-deployment.md).

### Purpose

This dashboard serves the following purposes:
 
- It provides an overview of how the cluster as a whole performs in terms of the successful execution of requests and the response time.

- It also provides the basic details of the nodes and services deployed in the cluster. This can indicate how each node/service affects the overall cluster performance. e.g., If the **Error Rate** widget indicates a surge in the error rate at a particular time, you can identify a node/service that started at around the same time (as shown by the **Node List** and **Service List** widgets) as a possible cause of it.

- It provides access to other dashboards that display statistics related to specific nodes and services so that you can carry out further analysis relating to the performance of your Micro Integrator set up.

### Recommended action

- Identify the times at which the error rate and/or the response time has been rising. Depending on the time, you can investigate the cause of if (e.g., a node/service that started around the same time). 

- Click on the nodes/services that you have identified as nodes/services to be further analyzed to improve the performance of your Micro Integrator set up, and view the visualizations specific to them.

- Based on the request count, make the appropriate decisions with regard to the resource allocation (i.e., whether to add or reduce the number of nodes to to leave the present number unchanged).

- Identify the popular services and make business decisions accordingly. For example, if there is a surge in the request rate, you can identify the services that were active  during that time. You can analyze such services in more detail by viewing information specific to them and decide whether to invest more in them.

## Node dashboard

This displays statistics specific to a selected node.

### Downloading the dashboard

You can download the dashboard from the [Grafana Labs - WSO2 Integration Node Metrics](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/12887).

For instructions to set up this dashboard, see [Setting Up the Cloud Native Observability Deployment]({{base_path}}/install-and-setup/setup/mi-setup/observability/setting-up-minimum-basic-observability-deployment.md).

### Statistic types

The following is the list of widgets displayed in this dashboard.

| **Widget**                     | **Description**   |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Up Time**                    | The time duration that has elapsed since the node became active for the current session.|                                                                                                              |
| **Service Count**              | The number of services (i.e., proxy services and REST API services) that are currently deployed in the node.|
| **All Time Request Count**     | The total number of requests received by the node after it became a member of the current Micro Integrator setup.|
| **All Time Error Count**       | The total number of requests handled by the node that have resulted in errors.|
| **CPU Utilization**            | A visualization of the node's CPU consumption over time.|
| **JVM Heap Memory**            | A visualization of the amount of JVM heap memory consumed by the node over time.|
| **Thread Count**               | A visualization of the number of threads allocated to the node over time. |
| **Open File Descriptor Count** ||
| **Services List**              | The complete list of services (i.e., proxy services and REST API services) that are currently deployed in the node.|
| **Request Rate**               | A visualization of the total number of requests received by the node over time. |
| **Error Rate**                 | A visualization of the total number of requests handled by the node that have resulted in errors over time. |
| **Response Time**              | A visualization of the amount of time taken by the node to respond to requests over time. |

### Purpose

The purposes of this dashboard are as follows:

- It shows the performance of individual nodes in terms of the error count and the response time.

- It allows you to track the resource consumption of individual nodes and make decisions accordingly (e.g., to allocate more CPU cores, undeploy services with a high throughput if the node does not have sufficient system resources to run them etc.).

- By clicking on the name of a service deployed in the selected node, you can open the **Proxy Service Dashbaord** and the **API Dashboard** dashboard (depending on the type of the service) to view statistics specific to the selected service.

### Recommended action

- Evaluate whether the resources allocated to the node (i.e., system memory, CPU cores, etc.) are sufficient/excessive in proportion to the throughput it handles (i.e., the number of requests within a specific duration of time), and make changes accordingly. e.g., If the number of requests handles is less in proportion to the capacity of the node in terms of system resources, you can either reduce the number of resources to reduce your cost or deploy more services in the node to utilize the existing resources in a more optimum manner.

- Click on the services deployed in the node to view statistics specific to those services. This allows you evaluate the throughput of each service to analyze further and make decisions on how to deploy the available services in the available nodes in a manner that optimizes the use of resources. It also allows you to identify the services that contribute to the total error count of the node and take appropriate action.

## WSO2 Proxy Service Metrics dashboard

### Purpose

The purposes of this dashboard is as follows:

- To understand the performance of a selected proxy service in terms of the number of requests it processes within a given time duration, the number/percentage of errors that has resulted, and the time taken by the proxy service to respond to requests.

- To understand the client demand for the related business based on the number of requests received by the proxy service.

### Recommended action 

- If the number of requests/response time is too high, deploy the proxy service in more nodes in the cluster so that the throughput is divided.

- If there are errors, check the mediation flow of the proxy service and make changes to prevent the errors.
