# Using the EI Analytics Portal

Let's use **EI Analytics** to view and monitor **statistics** and **message tracing**.

You can monitor the following statistics and more through the EI Analytics portal:

- Request Count
- Overall TPS
- Overall Message Count
- Top Proxy Services by Request Count
- Top APIs by Request Count
- Top Endpoints by Request Count
- Top Inbound Endpoints by Request Count
- Top Sequences by Request Count

!!! Tip
    Monitoring the usage of the integration runtime using statistical information is very important for understanding the overall health of a system that runs in production. Statistical data helps to do proper capacity planning, to keep the runtimes in a healthy state, and for debugging and troubleshooting problems. When it comes to troubleshooting, the ability to trace messages that pass through the mediation flows of the Micro Integrator is very useful.

## Before you begin

-   Set up the [EI Analytics deployment]({{base_path}}/install-and-setup/setup/mi-setup/observability/setting-up-classic-observability-deployment).
-   Note the following server directories in your deployment.

    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>
                EI_ANALYTICS_HOME
            </th>
            <td>
                This is the root folder of your EI Analytics installation.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>
                EI_7.1.0_HOME
            </th>
            <td>
                This is the root folder of your EI 7.1.0 installation.
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>

## Starting the servers

Let's start the servers in the given order.

### Starting the Analytics Server

!!! Note
    Be sure to start the **Analytics** server before [starting the Micro Integrator](#starting-the-micro-integrator).

1.  Open a terminal and navigate to the `<EI_ANALYTICS_HOME>/bin` directory.
2.  Start the Analytics server by executing the following command:

    ```bash tab='On MacOS/Linux/Centos'
    sh server.sh
    ```

    ```bash tab='On Windows'
    server.bat
    ```

### Starting the Micro Integrator

Once you have [started the Analytics Server](#starting-the-analytics-server), you can [start the Micro Integrator]({{base_path}}/install-and-setup/install/installing-the-product/install-mi-in-vm-installer/).

### Starting the Analytics Portal

1.  Open a terminal and navigate to the `<EI_ANALYTICS_HOME>/bin` directory.
2.  Start the Analytics Portal's runtime by executing the following command:

    ```bash tab='On MacOS/Linux/Centos'
    sh portal.sh
    ```

    ```bash tab='On Windows'
    portal.bat
    ```

In a new browser window or tab, open the Analytics portal using the following URL: https://localhost:9645/analytics-dashboard. 
Use `admin` for both the username and password.

## Publishing statistics to the Portal

Let's **test this solution** by running the [service chaining]({{base_path}}/tutorials/integration-tutorials/exposing-several-services-as-a-single-service) tutorial. When the artifacts deployed in the Micro Integrator are invoked, the statistics will be available in the portal. 

Follow the steps given below.

??? note "Step 1: Deploy integration artifacts"
    
    If you have already started the Micro Integrator server, let's deploy the artifacts. Let's use the integration artifacts from the [service chaining]({{base_path}}/tutorials/integration-tutorials/exposing-several-services-as-a-single-service) tutorial.

    1. Download the [CAR file](https://github.com/wso2-docs/WSO2_EI/blob/master/Analytics/Integration-Artifacts/SampleServicesCompositeExporter_1.0.0.car).
    2. Copy the CAR file to the `<MI_HOME>/repository/deployment/server/carbonapps/` directory.

??? note "Step 2: Start the backend"
    
    Let's start the hospital service that serves as the backend to the [service chaining]({{base_path}}/tutorials/integration-tutorials/exposing-several-services-as-a-single-service) use case: 

    1. Download the JAR file of the back-end service from [here](https://github.com/wso2-docs/WSO2_EI/blob/master/Back-End-Service/Hospital-Service-JDK11-2.0.0.jar).
    2. Open a terminal, navigate to the location where your saved the back-end service.
    3. Execute the following command to start the service:
        ```bash
        java -jar Hospital-Service-JDK11-2.0.0.jar
        ```

??? note "Step 3: Sending messages"
    
    Let's send 8 requests to the Micro Integrator to invoke the integration artifacts:

    !!! Tip
        For the purpose of demonstrating how successful messages and message failures are illustrated in the portal, let's send 2 of the requests while the back-end service is not running. This should generate a success rate of 75%.

    1.  Create a JSON file called `request.json` with the following request payload.
        ```json
        {
            "name": "John Doe",
            "dob": "1940-03-19",
            "ssn": "234-23-525",
            "address": "California",
            "phone": "8770586755",
            "email": "johndoe@gmail.com",
            "doctor": "thomas collins",
            "hospital": "grand oak community hospital",
            "cardNo": "7844481124110331",
            "appointment_date": "2025-04-02"
        }
        ```

    2.  Open a command line terminal and execute the following command (**six times**) from the location where you save the
        `request.json` file:  
        ```bash
        curl -v -X POST --data @request.json http://localhost:8290/healthcare/categories/surgery/reserve --header "Content-Type:application/json"
        ```
        If the messages are sent successfully, you will receive the following response for each request.
        ```json
        {
            "appointmentNo": 1,
            "doctorName": "thomas collins",
            "patient": "John Doe",
            "actualFee": 7000.0,
            "discount": 20,
            "discounted": 5600.0,
            "paymentID": "e1a72a33-31f2-46dc-ae7d-a14a486efc00",
            "status": "Settled"
        }
        ```

    3.  Now, shut down the back-end service and send two more requests.
