# Observability Overview

This section explains how to set up the observability solutions and perform management tasks with WSO2 API Manager.

## Observability

Observability can be viewed as a superset of monitoring where monitoring is enriched with capabilities to perform debugging and profiling through rich context, log analysis, correlation, and tracing. Modern day observability resides on three pillars of **logs**, **metrics**, and **tracing**. Modern businesses require observability systems to self-sufficiently emit their current state(overview), generate alerts for any abnormalities detected to proactively identify failures, and to provide information to find the root causes of a system failure.

WSO2 API Manager currently offers multiple observability solutions that can be broadly classified into the following categories:

- **APIM Analytics**

    This mainly refers to the APIM Analytic solution that allows you to analyze APIM statistics to derive business insights from APIs.
    
- **Integration observability solutions**

    These solutions observe statistics generated by the Integration server. This allows you to analyze the performance of the integration artifacts, monitor the overall health of the integration servar and to derive business insights.
    
- **Streaming observability solutions**

    These solutions observe statistics generated by the Streaming server so that you can monitor the overall health of the Streaming server, analyze the performance of Streaming artifacts, and to analyze the efficiency with which ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations are carried out.
