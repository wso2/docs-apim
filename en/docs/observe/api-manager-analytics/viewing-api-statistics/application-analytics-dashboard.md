# Application analytics

!!! info
      Similar to the other dashboards, the Application Analytics Dashboard can be viewed by admin users and users who have the `internal/subscriber` role. By default, the dashboard cannot be viewed by users having the `internal/analytics` role. 
      However, these permissions can be changed based on your preferences using the **Settings** option in the dashboard. For more information, see [Managing Analytics Dashboard Permissions]({{base_path}}/observe/api-manager-analytics/managing-dashboard-permissions/).


Log into the analytics-dashboard application and access application analytics dashboard (ex: [https://localhost:9643/analytics-dashboard/dashboards/application](https://localhost:9643/analytics-dashboard/dashboards/application)) dashboard from there.

#### Faulty Invocation per Application

In a faulty API invocation, the message is mediated though the fault sequence. 
By default, the API Manager considers an API invocation to be faulty when the backend service is unavailable or if a runtime exception occurs that is related to the backend communication.
The total number of invocations made by each application that are faulty are represented in these statistics.
