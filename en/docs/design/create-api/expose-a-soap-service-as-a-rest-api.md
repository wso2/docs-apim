# Expose a SOAP Service as a REST API

WSO2 API Manager supports the management of an existing SOAP and WSDL based services exposing as REST APIs.
The organizations that have SOAP/WSDL based services can easily bridge their existing services to REST without the cost of a major migration. WSO2 API Manager supports two types of services. One service performs a pass-through of the SOAP message to the backend, and the other service generates [a RESTful API from the backend SOAP service]({{base_path}}/design/create-api/generate-rest-api-from-soap-backend/).

Follow the instructions below to create a SOAP service as a RESTful API using **Pass Through**

1.  Sign in to the API Publisher and click **CREATE API**.

     [![Create SOAP API]({{base_path}}/assets/img/learn/create-soap-api.jpg)]({{base_path}}/assets/img/learn/create-soap-api.jpg)

2.  Select the **Pass Through** option and thereafter, select one of the following options:

     * WSDL URL - If you select this option, you need to provide an endpoint URL.

     * WSDL Archive/File - If you select this option, click Browse and upload either an individual WSDL file or a WSDL archive, which is a WSDL project that has multiple WSDLs.

     <p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
     <p>When uploading a WSDL archive, all the dependent WSDLS/XSDS that are referred to in the parent WSDL file should reside inside the WSDL archive itself. If not, the validation will fail at the point of API creation.</p>
     </div>
     </html>

     This example uses the WSDL [Phone Verify](http://ws.cdyne.com/phoneverify/phoneverify.asmx?wsdl) from CDYNE as the endpoint here, but you can use any SOAP backend of your choice.

3.  Click **NEXT** to proceed to the next phase, provide the information in the table below, and click **CREATE**.

    | Field   | Sample Value       |
    |---------|--------------------|
    | Name    | PhoneVerification  |
    | Context | /phoneverify       |
    | Version | 1.0                |
    | Endpoint| http://ws.cdyne.com/phoneverify/phoneverify.asmx|

     The created API appears in the Publisher as follows.

4. Click **API Definition** to view the API definition of the created schema.

     If you wish to add scopes to the resources that were created, click  **Resources**. Thereafter, create new scopes and specify them under operation scope. If you specify a scope, you need to use the same scope when generating access tokens for the subscribed application to invoke the API. For more information on working with the scopes, see [OAuthscopes]({{base_path}}/design/api-security/oauth2/oauth2-scopes/fine-grained-access-control-with-oauth-scopes/).

     <p> Note that when creating this API, **API Level** was selected as the default option for the **Rate limiting level**. For more information on setting advanced throttling policies,
     see [Enforce Throttling and Resource Access Policies]({{base_path}}/design/rate-limiting/setting-throttling-limits/).</p>

Now, the SOAP service is created and configured successfully as a RESTful API.
