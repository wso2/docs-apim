# Overview

API authentication is a way of protecting API access from unidentified or anonymous access. It ensures that the API is secured and accessible only by the consumers who proves their identity and whose identities are found within the API Management Platform. 

WSO2 API Manager offers the following authentication mechanisms to secure your API from unauthenticated access.
