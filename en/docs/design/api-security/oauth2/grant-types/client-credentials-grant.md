# Client Credentials Grant

Client credentials can be used when the authorization scope is limited to the protected resources belonging to the client. Client credentials are used as an authorization grant when the client requests access to protected resources based on an authorization previously arranged with the authorization server. The client application requests an access token from the authorization server, authenticating the request with its client key and client secret. If the client is successfully authenticated, an access token is returned.

Please refer to the [WSO2 IS documentation](https://is.docs.wso2.com/en/5.10.0/learn/client-credentials-grant/) for a detailed explanation on this grant type.

#### Flow

The client can request an access token using only its client credentials with this grant type. It is similar to the [resource owner password credentials grant]({{base_path}}/api-security/oauth2/grant-types/password-grant/) type except in this case, only the clientâ€™s credentials are used to authenticate a request for an access token.

### Invoking the Token API to generate the tokens

1.  Get a valid consumer key and consumer secret pair. Initially, you generate these keys through the API Developer Portal by clicking **GENERATE KEYS** on the **Production Keys** tab of the application.
2.  Combine the consumer key and consumer secret keys in the format `consumer-key:consumer-secret` and encode the combined string using [base64](http://base64encode.org/).
3.  Use the following sample cURL command to obtain the access token.

    ``` java tab="Format"
    curl -k -d "grant_type=client_credentials" -H "Authorization: Basic <Base64-encoded-client_key:client_secret>" -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" https://localhost:<https-port>/token -v
    ```

    ``` java tab="Example"
    curl -k -d "grant_type=client_credentials" -H "Authorization: Basic cEJ6dUlaaEdwaGZRbWRjVVgwbG5lRmlpdXh3YTo0U0pnV19qTU56aGpIU284OGJuZVhtTnFNMjRh" -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" https://localhost:8243/token -v
    ```

    **Response**
    ```
        > POST /token HTTP/1.1
        > Host: localhost:8243
        > User-Agent: curl/7.54.0
        > Accept: */*

    ```

!!! info
    The following command can be used to obtain the access token by specifying the scope.

    ``` java tab="Format"
    curl -k -d "grant_type=client_credentials&scope=test" -H "Authorization: Basic <ConsumerKey:ConsumerSecret>" -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" https://localhost:8243/token
    ```
    
    ``` java tab="Example"
    curl -k -d "grant_type=client_credentials&scope=test" -H "Authorization: Basic cEJ6dUlaaEdwaGZRbWRjVVgwbG5lRmlpdXh3YTo0U0pnV19qTU56aGpIU284OGJuZVhtTnFNMjRh" -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" https://localhost:8243/token
    ```


!!! tip
    We use the Client Credentials grant type to generate access tokens for an application through the API Developer Portal. Therefore, you should enable this grant type to the application. To do that, go to the API Developer Portal, click the application name from under the **APPLICATIONS** tab, click the **Production Keys** tab, and select the **Client Credentials** check box under **Grant Types** in **Key Configurations**.

!!! tip
    If you want to **disable the Client Credentials grant type** in the APIM instance, add the following entry to the `deployment.toml` file in the `<APIM_HOME>/repository/conf/` folder.

    ``` toml
    [oauth.grant_type.client_credentials]
    enable = false
    ```

!!! info
    **Setting a custom validity time for access tokens**

    You can set a validity period for access tokens through a cURL command. Pass the <code>validity_period</code> parameter as shown in the example below.

    ``` java tab="Format"
    curl -X POST -k -H "Authorization: Basic <Base64(clientId:clientSecret)>" -d "grant_type=client_credentials&validity_period=<custom_validity_time_in_seconds>" -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" https://localhost:8243/token -v
    ```
    
    ``` java tab="Example"
    curl -X POST -k -H "Authorization: Basic cEJ6dUlaaEdwaGZRbWRjVVgwbG5lRmlpdXh3YTo0U0pnV19qTU56aGpIU284OGJuZVhtTnFNMjRh" -d "grant_type=client_credentials&validity_period=3200" -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" https://localhost:8243/token -v
    ```
    
!!! note "Support for refresh token grant - No"
	This grant type does not issue a refresh token which can be used to obtain new access tokens using the [refresh token grant](http://localhost:8000/learn/api-security/oauth2/grant-types/refresh-token-grant/).
