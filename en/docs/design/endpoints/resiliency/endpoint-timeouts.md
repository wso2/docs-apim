# Endpoint Timeouts

WSO2 API Manager allows you to control the production and sandbox endpoints using the Advanced Endpoint Configurations.

Configure the Advanced Endpoint Configurations as follows:

1. Sign in to the API Publisher Portal.
   
    `https://<hostname>:9443/publisher` 
   
    Example: `https://localhost:9443/publisher`

    Use your username and password to sign in.

2. Click on an API in the API Publisher Portal listing page.

3. Click **Endpoint**.
     
4. Click on the cogwheel, which is inline with the endpoint that you need to configure, and update the endpoint related configurations as required.

The following are Advanced Endpoint Configurations that you can configure for bothÂ the production and sandbox endpoints.
