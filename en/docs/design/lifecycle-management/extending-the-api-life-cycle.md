## Default API Lifecycle in WSO2 API Manager

The WSO2 registry based life cycle provides a configurable way to define the life cycle of an artifact, which can be extended easily, as the default API life cycle is defined as an XML configuration.

To see the default API life cycle configuration, follow the steps given below.

1.  Start the API Manager server and log into the management console: <https://localhost:9443/carbon>.

2.  Navigate to **Extensions &gt; Configure &gt; Lifecycles**.

3.  Click the **View/Edit** link corresponding to the API LifeCycle. The default API life cycle configuration opens.

                            <data name="transitionExecution">
                                <execution forEvent="Retire"
                                           class="org.wso2.carbon.apimgt.impl.executors.APIExecutor">
                                </execution>
                            </data>
                        </datamodel>
                        <transition event="Retire" target="Retired"/>
                    </state>
                    <state id="Retired">
                    </state>
                </scxml>
            </lifecycle>
        </configuration>
    </aspect>
    ```
    
The above configuration includes the following important information:

1.  Lifecycle name: APILifeCycle.

2.  Set of six default states: 
    -   CREATED
    -   PROTOTYPED 
    -   PUBLISHED
    -   BLOCKED
    -   DEPRECATED
    -   RETIRED

3.  Set of checklist items to be satisfied.
    For example, when the API is in the **CREATED** state and has multiple versions, there are two checklist items that needs to be provided when changing the lifecycle state to Publish:
    
    1.  Deprecate old versions 
    2.  Require re-subscriptions

4.  State transition events: Defines from which state to which target state of an API can be moved.

5.  Actions for each state transition: A triggered action that executes during each state transition. For example, when an API state changes from **CREATED** to **PUBLISHED** , an execution occurs as a relative synapse API where an XML element is created and the related API data is saved in the database. This execution is defined for each state transition in the above registry life cycle configuration.


    The state transition events that occur in the default API life cycle is shown in the following diagram:

    ![]({{base_path}}/assets/img/learn/lifecycle_tab.png)

The **Lifecycle** tab in the Publisher, shows the current state of an API, the target events defined in the API life cycle for that state, and the set of checklist items.

![]({{base_path}}/assets/img/learn/lifecycle-image-with-checklist-items.png)

!!! Info

    This UI is static in the default stage and need to customize the lifecycle diagram to add any custom lifecycle state.

If you customize the default API life cycle configuration including states, transition events or check list items, those changes are updated in the **Lifecycle** tab of the Publisher UI accordingly.


## Extension Points of API Lifecycle

With the integration of the registry life cycle to the API life cycle of API Manager, it is possible to extend the existing API life cycle and customize it according to your preference.

!!! tip
    Consider the following points when extending and customising the API life cycle XML configuration.

    -   Do not change the life cycle name since it needs to be engaged with the APIs dynamically.
    -   Make sure you keep the **PUBLISHED** and **PROTOTYPED** states as those two states will be used by API Publisher in the API creation wizard.


Following are some extention points where the default API life cycle can be extended by modifying above mentioned XML configuration of the API life cycle.

-   [Define your own life cycle states]({{base_path}}/design/lifecycle-management/customize-api-life-cycle/) in the API life cycle
-   Change the state transition events as per the environmental preferences
-   Add custom checklist items for specific state transitions
-   Change the execution code for each state transition

!!! info
    By default, the same execution class is used ( `org.wso2.carbon.apimgt.impl.executors.APIExecutor` ) for all state transitions. However, you can plug your own execution code when modifying the life cycle configuration. 
    
    For example, if you want to add notifications for a specific state transition, you can plug your own custom execution class for that particular state in the API life cycle. Any changes are updated in the **Lifecycle** tab accordingly.


For example, a transition event called `Notify Users` can be introduced in the **DEPRECATED** state by modifying the default API lifecycle as follows,

``` xml
<state id="Deprecated">
    <datamodel>
        <data name="transitionExecution">
            <execution forEvent="Retire"
                        class="org.wso2.carbon.apimgt.impl.executors.APIExecutor">
            </execution>
        </data>
    </datamodel>
    <transition event="Retire" target="Retired"/>
    <transition event="Notify Users" target="Retired"/>
</state>
```

After adding this changes, if you Deprecate an API, the newly added transition option will be available in Lifecycle tab:
