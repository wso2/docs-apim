# Getting Started with MCP

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** in WSO2 API Manager provides a standardized way to expose *tool-style* capabilities as first-class APIs for AI, automation, and structured integrations. A MCP Server **describes its capabilities as tools** with machine-readable schemas and discovery.

## What is Model Context Protocol?

**MCP is a JSON-RPC–based protocol** that standardizes how applications interact with LLMs. It lets applications both share context (files, databases, APIs) with LLMs and **expose callable tools** that agents can invoke in workflows.

### Architecture (host–client–server)

* **Host** – Runtime where the MCP client lives (e.g., agent or gateway).
* **Client** – Mediates communication with one or more MCP servers.
* **Server** – Publishes tools, schemas, and metadata for discovery and invocation.

> For full protocol details, see the [official MCP specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro).

## MCP Core Concepts

* **Server** – The MCP API you manage, can expose one or more tools.
* **Tool** – A callable capability (e.g., `echo`, `summarize`, `getOrderStatus`) defined by input/output schemas.
* **Discovery** – Clients list tools, read metadata, and fetch schemas before invocation.

## Why MCP in APIM is Valuable

* Enforce **consistent security** across AI/automation endpoints.
* Provide **standardized metadata** for zero-guesswork client integration.
* Track **tool usage analytics** for capacity and optimization.
* Ship **versioned tool changes** with minimal disruption.

## Manage MCP Servers with WSO2 API Manager

WSO2 API Manager provides a unified platform for managing MCP Servers, enabling you to transform APIs into AI-ready tools and govern their lifecycle. With a centralized control plane, you can create, discover, and manage MCP Servers efficiently—streamlining workflows for both API developers and AI agent builders.

!!! note
    This guide walks you from defining tools to deploying and publishing a MCP Server in WSO2 API Manager.

## Quick Start (at a glance)

1. **Choose a creation path** (see below).
2. **Define/confirm tool schemas** (inputs/outputs, descriptions).
3. **Attach policies** (auth, rate limiting).
5. **Publish & test** (run discovery, call tools, review analytics).

!!! tip
    Keep input schemas minimal and strongly typed; LLMs perform better with concise, unambiguous contracts.

## Next Step → MCP Server Creation Options

WSO2 API Manager offers three ways to create a MCP Server:

1. **[Create a MCP Server by Importing an OpenAPI Definition](./create-from-openapi.md)** – Generate tools and configuration from an existing OpenAPI.
2. **[Create a MCP Server Using an Existing API](./create-from-api.md)** – Select an API already in APIM and convert operations into MCP tools.
3. **[Proxy a Existing MCP Server](./create-from-mcp-server.md)** – Wrap an external MCP server for governance, security, and analytics.
