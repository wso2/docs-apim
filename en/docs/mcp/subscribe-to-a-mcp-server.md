# Subscribe to a MCP Server

You have to **subscribe** to a published MCP Server before using its tools in your applications. The subscription process fulfills the authentication process and provides you with access tokens that you can use to invoke a MCP Server's tools. 

The examples here use the `Petstore` MCP Server, which is created and published to the Developer Portal in WSO2 API Manager.

## Subscribe to a application

If you already have an existing application, follow the instructions below to subscribe to the MCP Server using that application.

1.  Sign in to the Developer Portal (`https://<hostname>:<port>/devportal`) and click on the MCP Server (e.g., `Petstore`) to go to the MCP Server overview.

2.  Click **SUBSCRIBE TO AN APPLICATION**.

If you do not have an existing application, you can create one and then subscribe to the MCP Server. For detailed steps, refer to [Subscribe to an API]({{base_path}}/consume/manage-subscription/subscribe-to-an-api/), as the process is similar.
