### Install and run WSO2 Integration Studio

Follow the steps given below.

1.  Download the [distribution](https://wso2.com/integration/integration-studio/) for your operating system.
2.  Extract the downloaded file to get the **IntegrationStudio**
    application. 
    !!! note
        * If you are a MacOS user, be sure to add it to the **Applications** directory.
        * If you are a Microsoft Windows user, extract it outside the **Programs** directory. This is done because the Integration Studio requires permission to write to files.
3.  Run the **IntegrationStudio** application to start the tool.
