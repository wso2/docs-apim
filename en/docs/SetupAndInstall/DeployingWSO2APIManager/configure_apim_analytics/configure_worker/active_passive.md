# Configure a Analytics workers as active-passive

Minimum high availability deployment mainly focused on providing high availability which guarantees no data loss if the 
system suffer any failing due to several unforeseeable reasons. One of the main advantage of this is it uses minimum 
amount of infrastructure resources possible. Thus deployment pattern comprise of only two Streaming integration 
servers.

In minimum HA setup, one node is assigned as the active node while the other node is assigned as the passive node.
Only the active node processes the incoming events and publishes the outgoing events. Internally, the active node 
publishes the events to the passive node, but the passive node does not process or send any events outside as mentioned 
earlier. In a scenario where the active node fails, the passive node is activated, and it starts receiving events and 
then publishes them from where the active node left off. Once the terminated (previously active) node restarts , it 
operates in the passive state. In the passive node, sources are in an inactive mode where they will not receive events 
into the system. 

!!! note
    The ports that are open only in the active node at a given time include the Siddhi Store Query API endpoint to which 
    requests are sent by invoking the Siddhi Store REST API. These ports are configured in the 
    `<APIM_ANALYTICS_HOME>/conf/worker/deployment.yaml` file. For more information about this port configuration, see 
    Managing Stored Data via REST APIs.

    When a failover occurs, the Siddhi Store Query API endpoint configured in node 2 (which becomes the currently active node) is opened, and 
    all the store query traffic is directed to that endpoint.

!!! note
    In passive node databridge ports and Siddhi Store Query API endpoint are closed but the admin API are accessible. 

For a two-node minimum HA cluster to work, only the active node should receive events. By design, you can only send 
events to active node. To achieve this, you can use a load balancing mechanism that sends events in failover manner. See
 the diagram below.


### Prerequisites

In order to configure a minimum HA cluster, the following prerequisites must be completed:

  - It is recommended to run this setup with two CPUs. Each CPU should have four cores, and 4GB memory.
  - Two binary packs of WSO2 APIM ANALYTICS must be available.
  - A working RDBMS instance to be used for clustering of the 2 nodes. 
  - Download the MySQL connector from <a target="_blank" href="https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/">here</a>. 
    Extract and find the mysql-connector-java-5.*.*-bin.jar. Place this JAR in the 
    `<APIM_ANALYTICS_HOME>/lib` directory of both nodes. 
  - In order to retrieve the state of the Siddhi Applications deployed in the system in case of a scenario where both the 
    nodes fail, state persistence must be enabled for both nodes by specifying the same datasource/file location. 
    For detailed instructions, see <a target="_blank" href="configuring-Database-and-File-System-State-Persistence">
    Configuring Database and File System State Persistence</a> for more information.
  - A load balancer or some other client-side data publishing mechanism that works in a failover manner must be available 
    to publish events to one of the available nodes (i.e., to the active node). 
    
    
### Configuring a minimum HA cluster

There are three main configurations which need to be configured in order to setup a minimum HA cluster which can be 
categorized as below,
    
    - Cluster Configuration
    - Persistent configuration
    - HA configuration

!!! note

    - Note that the following configurations need to be done in the `<APIM_ANALYTICS_HOME>/conf/worker/deployment.yaml` 
      file for both the WSO2 API Analaytics nodes in the cluster.
    - If you need to run both APIM Analytics instances in the same host, make sure that you do a port offset to change the default 
      ports in one of the hosts. For more information about the default ports, see Configuring Default Ports.
      
See below the steps and configuration details need to carry out to configure the HA cluster.

1. For each node, enter a unique ID for the id property under the wso2.carbon section. (e.g., id: wso2-am_analytics). 
This is used to identify each node within a cluster.

2. To allow the two nodes to use same persistence storage, you need to configure RDBMS persistence configuration under
 the state.persistence. The following is a configuration for db-based persistence (Persistent configuration).
    ``` yaml
    - state.persistence:
        enabled: true
        intervalInMin: 1
        revisionsToKeep: 2
        persistenceStore: io.siddhi.distribution.core.persistence.DBPersistenceStore
        config:
          datasource: PERSISTENCE_DB   # A datasource with this name should be defined in wso2.datasources namespace
          table: PERSISTENCE_TABLE
    ```
          
     The datasource named PERSISTENCE_DB in the above configuration can be defined in the 
     `<APIM_ANALYTICS_HOME>/conf/worker/deployment.yaml` file under the `wso2.datasources` section. Following is a sample 
     datasource configuration.
    ```
    - name: PERSISTENCE_DB
          description: The MySQL datasource used for persistence
          jndiConfig:
            name: jdbc/PERSISTENCE_DB
          definition:
            type: RDBMS
            configuration:
              jdbcUrl: 'jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/PERSISTENCE_DB?useSSL=false'
              username: root
              password: root
              driverClassName: com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
              maxPoolSize: 50
              idleTimeout: 60000
              connectionTestQuery: SELECT 1
              validationTimeout: 30000
              isAutoCommit: false
    ```
              
3. To allow the two nodes in the cluster to coordinate effectively, configure carbon coordination by updating the 
cluster.config section of the `<APIM_ANALYTICS_HOME>/conf/worker/deployment.yaml` as follows (Cluster Configuration):
    - To enable the cluster mode, set the enabled property to true.
    - In order to cluster the two nodes together, enter the same ID as the group ID for both nodes 
        (e.g., groupId: group-1).
    - Enter the ID of the class that defines the coordination strategy for the cluster as shown in the example below.
        e.g., coordinationStrategyClass: org.wso2.carbon.cluster.coordinator.rdbms.RDBMSCoordinationStrategy
    - In the strategyConfig section, enter information as follows:
        - For clustering of the two nodes to take place
        - datasource - Enter the name of the configured datasource shared by the nodes in the cluster as shown in 
                             the example below. Data handled by the cluster are persisted here.
                
            Following is a sample datasource configuration for a MySQL datasource that should appear under the 
            dataSources section of the `wso2.datasources` section in the  `<APIM_ANALYTICS_HOME>/conf/worker/deployment.yaml`.
            For detailed instructions of how to configure a datasource, see Configuring Datasources.
            
            ```     
                #Sample MySQL datasource
                - name: WSO2_CLUSTER_DB
                  description: The MySQL datasource used for Cluster Coordination
                  jndiConfig:
                    name: jdbc/WSO2ClusterDB
                  definition:
                    type: RDBMS
                    configuration:
                      jdbcUrl: 'jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/WSO2_CLUSTER_DB?useSSL=false'
                      username: root
                      password: root
                      driverClassName: com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
                      maxPoolSize: 50
                      idleTimeout: 60000
                      connectionTestQuery: SELECT 1
                      validationTimeout: 30000
                      isAutoCommit: false
            ```
                         
        - heartbeatInterval - Define the time interval (in milliseconds) at which heartbeat pulse should occur 
                 for each node.  Recommended value for it is 5000 milliseconds
                 
        - heartbeatMaxRetry - Defines the number of times to wait till active node to become live again before 
                 passive node becomes active. Recommended value is 5 times.
                 
        - eventPollingInterval - Define the time interval (in milliseconds) at which each node should listen for 
                 changes that occur in the cluster. Recommended value for it is 5000 milliseconds
                 
        - Sample cluster configuration can be as below :
            ```  
            - cluster.config:
                enabled: true
                groupId:  group-1
                coordinationStrategyClass: org.wso2.carbon.cluster.coordinator.rdbms.RDBMSCoordinationStrategy
                strategyConfig:
                  datasource: WSO2_CLUSTER_DB
                  heartbeatInterval: 5000
                  heartbeatMaxRetry: 5
                  eventPollingInterval: 5000
            ```
                 
4. Next add the deployment.config section to the `<APIM_ANALYTICS_HOME>/conf/worker/deployment.yaml` file with following 
configurations (HA configuration)
    - To enable 2 node minimum HA, set the type property to "ha".
    - passiveNodeDetailsWaitTimeOutMillis - Time in milliseconds to wait till passive node details gets available in 
        database so that active node can retrieve them
    - passiveNodeDetailsRetrySleepTimeMillis - This defines how much time to sleep before retying to retrieve details 
        again
    - eventByteBufferQueueCapacity - Size of the queue which used to keep events in passive node
    - byteBufferExtractorThreadPoolSize - Number worker threads which reads events from the queue in passive node
    - To configure the TCP server via which event synchronization is carried out from active node to passive node, 
        add a subsection named eventSyncServer and enter information as follows:
        - host - Hostname of the server where the TCP server is spawn up
        - port - Port of the TCP server
        - advertisedHost - When the host can be different from actual server host
        - advertisedPort - When the port can be different from the actual port of the server
        - bossThreads - Define a number of boss threads for the TCP server to handle the connections. 
        
            > Default value is 10.
            
        - workerThreads - Define a number of worker threads for the TCP server to handle the connections.
        
            > Default value is 10.
                
    - To configure the TCP client via which requests are sent to the SI cluster, add a subsection named 
        eventSyncClientPool and add information as follows
        - maxActive - Define the maximum number of active connections that must be allowed in the TCP client pool
        
            > Default value is 10.
               
        - maxTotal - Define the maximum number of total connections that must be allowed in the TCP client pool
        
            > Default value is 10.
                
        - maxIdle - Define the maximum number of idle connections that must be allowed in the TCP client pool
        
            > Default value is 10.
                
        - maxWait - Define the number of milliseconds the client pool must wait for an idle object when the 
                connection pool.
                 
            > Default value is 60000.
                
        - minEvictableIdleTimeInMillis - Define the minimum number of milliseconds an object can sit idle in the 
                pool before it is eligible for eviction.
                 
            > Default value is 120000
                
    
        !!! note
            
            Usage between host , port and advertisedHost and advertisedPort is , in a container environment actual 
            server host and port can be different to exposing host and port. In such cases we can use advertisedHost and 
            advertisedPort
            
        Sample HA configuration can be as below :
           ```
           - deployment.config:
               type: ha
               passiveNodeDetailsWaitTimeOutMillis: 300000
               passiveNodeDetailsRetrySleepTimeMillis: 500
               eventByteBufferQueueCapacity: 20000
               byteBufferExtractorThreadPoolSize: 5
               eventSyncServer:
                 host: localhost
                 port: 9893
                 advertisedHost: localhost
                 advertisedPort: 9893
                 bossThreads: 10
                 workerThreads: 10  
               eventSyncClientPool:
                 maxActive: 10
                 maxTotal: 10
                 maxIdle: 10
                 maxWait: 60000
                 minEvictableIdleTimeMillis: 120000
                 
           ```

5. Configure APIM_ANALYTICS_DB in `<APIM_ANALYTICS_HOME>/conf/worker/deployment.yaml`
    
   ``` yaml
    
   - name: APIM_ANALYTICS_DB
         description: "The datasource used for APIM statistics aggregated data."
         jndiConfig:
           name: jdbc/APIM_ANALYTICS_DB
         definition:
           type: RDBMS
           configuration:
             jdbcUrl: "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/APIM_ANALYTICS_DB_1?useSSL=false"
             password: pass
             username: root
             driverClassName: com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
             maxPoolSize: 50
             idleTimeout: 60000
             connectionTestQuery: SELECT 1
             validationTimeout: 30000
             isAutoCommit: false
         
   ```
               
   - If you are configure analytics for WSO2 Micro Gateway, import the 
       appropriate DB script from `<APIM_ANALYTICS_HOME>/wso2/worker/dbscripts/apimgt/`
       
###Starting the cluster

1. Save the required Siddhi applications in the `<APIM_ANALYTICS_HOME>/wso2/worker/deployment/siddhi-files` directory in 
both nodes. In order to ensure that the Siddhi applications are completely synchronized between the active and 
the passive node, they must be added to the siddhi-files  directory before the server startup. However, the 
synchronization can take place effectively even if the Siddhi applications are added while the server is running. 
    
2. Start both servers by navigating to  `<APIM_ANALYTICS_HOME>/bin` and issuing the following command:
    ```
    For Windows: server.bat 
    For Linux : ./server.sh
    ```    
    If the cluster is correctly configured, the following CLI logs can be viewed without any error logs:
        
    !!! note

        In deploying Siddhi applications in a two node minimum HA cluster, it is recommended to use a content 
        synchronization mechanism since Siddhi applications must be deployed to both server nodes. You can use a common 
        shared file system such as Network File System (NFS) or any other shared file system that is available. 
        You need to mount the `<APIM_ANALYTICS_HOME>/wso2/worker/deployment/siddhi-files` directory of the two nodes to 
        the shared file system. 
        
    !!! note
    
        To start two WSO2 SI Nodes in the same machine, the listenerConfigurations under the wso2.transport.http namespace 
        in the `<APIM_ANALYTICS_HOME>/conf/worker/deployment.yaml` file must be updated to listen to different ports. The 
        offset property under the ports section of the wso2.carbon section found in the `<APIM_ANALYTICS_HOME>/conf/worker/deployment.yaml`
        should also be changed in one SI instance to avoid conflicts when starting both servers.
