# Moesif Analytics Integration

!!! info "New in 4.6.0 â€” Moesif-powered WSO2 Analytics replaces Choreo Analytics for enhanced insights and observability."

## Overview

This guide outlines the steps required to integrate **Moesif Analytics** with **WSO2 API Manager**. The integration enables you to collect and publish API analytics data to the **Moesif dashboard**, providing insights into API usage, traffic trends, and error tracking in near real-time.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- WSO2 API Manager 4.6.0
- Administrative access to WSO2 APIM configuration files
- A valid email address for Moesif account creation
- Estimated setup time: 5-10 minutes

### Analytics Data Flow

The Moesif integration captures both **successful** and **failed** API invocations in WSO2 API Manager and publishes them to your Moesif dashboard in near real-time. This allows for powerful analytics and monitoring capabilities.

## Step 1: Set Up Your Moesif Account

### 1.1 Create an Account and Log In

1. Go to [Moesif's official website for WSO2 API Manager](https://www.moesif.com/wrap/basic?onboard=true)
2. Sign up for a new account or log in to your existing account
3. Follow the onboarding wizard to get the Moesif Key
4. Copy the **Moesif API Key** from the **API Keys** section (you will need this in Step 2)

> **Note:** For more detailed instructions and advanced configuration options, refer to the official [Moesif Documentation](https://www.moesif.com/docs).

## Step 2: Configure WSO2 API Manager

To enable Moesif analytics in WSO2 APIM, you need to update the `deployment.toml` configuration file.

### 2.1 Configure the deployment.toml File

1. Navigate to the `<APIM-HOME>/repository/conf` directory
2. Open the `deployment.toml` file in a text editor
3. Add or update the `apim.analytics` configuration with the following:

```toml
[apim.analytics]
enable = true
type = "moesif"

[apim.analytics.properties]
moesifKey = "YOUR_MOESIF_API_KEY_HERE"
moesif_base_url = "https://api.moesif.net"
send_headers = false
```

Replace `YOUR_MOESIF_API_KEY_HERE` with the actual API key you copied from Step 1.4.

### Configuration Parameters

| **Name** | **Description** | **Default Value** | **Possible Data Types** | **Optional** |
|----------|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------------|--------------|
| enable | Enable/Disable Analytics | true | Boolean | Yes |
| type | Type of Analytics platform | moesif | String | Yes |
| moesifKey | Moesif API Key | - | String | No |
| moesif_base_url | Base URL of Moesif API | https://api.moesif.com | String | Yes |
| send_headers | Whether to send request and response headers to Moesif | false | Boolean | Yes |

### 2.2 Restart WSO2 API Manager

After saving the configuration changes, restart WSO2 API Manager for the changes to take effect:

```bash
cd <APIM-HOME>/bin
./api-manager.sh stop
./api-manager.sh start
```

## Security: Masking Sensitive Information

> **Warning:** Ensure that you **do not** expose your Moesif API Key in public repositories or logs, as it can lead to unauthorized access to your analytics data.

### Understanding Data Privacy Requirements

WSO2 Analytics data may contain PII (Personally Identifiable Information) such as user IP addresses and usernames. Additionally, when `send_headers` is set to `true`, request and response headers may contain sensitive information like authorization tokens or API keys.

To comply with data privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.) and protect user privacy, it is strongly recommended to mask or anonymize such sensitive information before sending it to Moesif.

### Configuring Data Masking

Add the following configuration to your `deployment.toml` file to enable data masking:

```toml
[apim.analytics.mask]
"userIp" = "IPV4"
"userName" = "EMAIL"
"userId" = "EMAIL"
"userAgent" = "STRING"
"applicationOwner" = "EMAIL"
response_headers = ["Authorization", "X-API-Key"]
request_headers = ["Authorization", "Cookie"]
```

### Masking Configuration Reference

| **Name** | **Description** | **Accepted Values** |
|----------|-----------------|---------------------|
| userIp | Defines the format used to capture and store the user's IP address in analytics records | IPV4, IPV6 |
| userName | Specifies the format of the username field used for analytics or identification | EMAIL, STRING |
| userId | Identifies how the user ID is represented in analytics data | EMAIL, STRING |
| userAgent | Represents the type of the user agent string recorded from the client request | STRING |
| applicationOwner | Specifies the format of the application owner's identifier | EMAIL, STRING |
| response_headers | List of response headers to be masked for analytics or logging purposes | Header keys as strings |
| request_headers | List of request headers to be masked for analytics or logging purposes | Header keys as strings |

### Masking Behavior Examples

- **IPV4**: Masks the 3rd octet of an IPv4 address
    - Original: `192.168.1.98`
    - Masked: `192.168.***.98`

- **IPV6**: Masks the 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th segments of an IPv6 address
    - Original: `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`
    - Masked: `2001:0db8:85a3:****:****:****:****:7334`

- **EMAIL**: Masks the local part of an email address
    - Original: `john.doe@gmail.com`
    - Masked: `*****@gmail.com`

- **STRING**: Masks the entire string value
    - Original: `JohnDoe`
    - Masked: `*****`

## Analytics Event Types

WSO2 API Manager generates two types of analytics events that are sent to Moesif:

### apim_event_response

This event is triggered for each successful API invocation. Even when an API-associated backend returns an error response, it will be logged through this event (as the gateway successfully processed the request).

## Troubleshooting

### Analytics Data Not Appearing in Moesif

If you don't see data in your Moesif dashboard after configuration:

1. **Verify the API Key**: Ensure the `moesifKey` in `deployment.toml` matches the key from your Moesif account
2. **Check WSO2 Logs**: Review `<APIM-HOME>/repository/logs/wso2carbon.log` for analytics-related errors
3. **Confirm Restart**: Ensure you restarted WSO2 APIM after making configuration changes
4. **Test API Invocation**: Make a test API call and wait 2-3 minutes for data to appear in Moesif
5. **Network Connectivity**: Verify that your WSO2 APIM server can reach `https://api.moesif.com`

### Common Configuration Errors

- **Missing or Invalid API Key**: Double-check that the Moesif API key is correctly copied without extra spaces
- **Configuration Syntax Errors**: Ensure proper TOML syntax in `deployment.toml` (proper quotes, brackets, etc.)
- **Firewall Issues**: Ensure outbound HTTPS connections to Moesif are allowed

### Performance Considerations

Enabling analytics introduces minimal overhead:

- **Latency Impact**: Typically less than 5ms per API call (asynchronous processing)
- **Resource Usage**: Minimal CPU and memory impact due to efficient event batching
- **Network**: Events are batched and sent in the background to minimize network calls
