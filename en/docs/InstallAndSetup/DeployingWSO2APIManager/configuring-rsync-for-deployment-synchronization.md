# Configuring rsync for Deployment Synchronization

Deployment synchronization can be done using [rsync](https://download.samba.org/pub/rsync/rsync.html), which is a file copying tool. These changes must be done in the manager node and in the same directory.

1.  Create a file named `workers-list.txt` , somewhere in your machine, that lists all the worker nodes in the deployment. The following is a sample of the file where there are two worker nodes.

    !!! tip
        Different nodes are separated by new lines.

    **workers-list.txt**

    ``` java
    ubuntu@192.168.1.1:~/setup/192.168.1.1/as/as_worker/repository/deployment/server
    ubuntu@192.168.1.2:~/setup/192.168.1.2/as/as_worker/repository/deployment/server
    ```

    !!! note
        If you have configured tenants in worker nodes, you need to add the `repository/tenants` directory of the worker node to the list to synchronize tenant space. For example, if the node `ubuntu@192.168.1.1` needs to be synced with both the super tenant and the tenant space, the following two entries should be added to the `workers-list.txt` file.

        **workers-list.txt**

        ``` java
        ubuntu@192.168.1.1:~/setup/192.168.1.1/apim/apim_worker/repository/deployment/server
        ubuntu@192.168.1.1:~/setup/192.168.1.1/apim/apim_worker/repository/tenants
        ```

2.  Create a file toÂ synchronize the `<API-M_HOME>/repository/deployment/server` folders between the manager and all worker nodes.

    !!! note
        You must create your own SSH key and define it as the `pem_file` . Alternatively, you can use an existing SSH key. For information on generating and using the SSH Keys, go to the [SSH documentation](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/keygen/) . Specify the `manager_server_dir` depending on the location in your local machine. Change the `logs.txt` file path and the lock location based on where they are located in your machine.

    **rsync-for-carbon-depsync.sh**

    ``` java
    #!/bin/sh
    manager_server_dir=~/wso2as-5.2.1/repository/deployment/server/
    pem_file=~/.ssh/carbon-440-test.pem


    #delete the lock on exit
    trap 'rm -rf /var/lock/depsync-lock' EXIT 

    mkdir /tmp/carbon-rsync-logs/


    #keep a lock to stop parallel runs
    if mkdir /var/lock/depsync-lock; then
      echo "Locking succeeded" >&2
    else
      echo "Lock failed - exit" >&2
      exit 1
    fi

    #get the workers-list.txt
    pushd `dirname $0` > /dev/null
    SCRIPTPATH=`pwd`
    popd > /dev/null
    echo $SCRIPTPATH


    for x in `cat ${SCRIPTPATH}/workers-list.txt`
    do
    echo ================================================== >> /tmp/carbon-rsync-logs/logs.txt;
    echo Syncing $x;
    rsync --delete -arve "ssh -i  $pem_file -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no" $manager_server_dir $x >> /tmp/carbon-rsync-logs/logs.txt
    echo ================================================== >> /tmp/carbon-rsync-logs/logs.txt;
    done
    ```

3.  Create a Cron job that executes the above file every minute for deployment synchronization. Do this by running the following command in your command line.

    !!! note
        You can only run the Cron job on one given node (master) at a given time. If you switch the Cron job to another node, you must stop the Cron job on the existing node and start a new Cron job on the new node after updating it with the latest files.


    ``` java
    *   *  *   *   *     /home/ubuntu/setup/rsync-for-depsync/rsync-for-depsync.sh
    ```
