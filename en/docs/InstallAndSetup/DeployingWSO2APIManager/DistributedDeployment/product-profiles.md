# Product Profiles

When a WSO2 product starts, it starts all components, features and related artifacts bundled with it. Multi-profile support allows you to run the product on a selected profile so that only the features specific to that profile along with common features start up with the server.

!!! tip
Starting a product on a preferred profile only blocks/allows the relevant OSGI bundles. As a result, even if you start the server on a profile such as the `api-devportal` for example, you can still access the API Publisher web application.

!!! info
OSGI Bundle

OSGI bundle is a tightly coupled, dynamically loadable collection of classes, jars, and configuration files that explicitly declare their external dependencies (if any). In OSGi, a bundle is the primary deployment format. Bundles are applications that are packaged in JARs, and can be installed, started, stopped, updated, and removed.

### API-M Profiles

The following are the different profiles available in WSO2 API Manager.

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Profile</th>
<th>Command Option with Profile Name</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Gateway worker</td>
<td><pre><code>-Dprofile=gateway-worker   </code></pre></td>
<td><div class="content-wrapper">
<p>Only starts the components related to the API Gateway.</p>
<p>You use this when the API Gateway acts as a worker node in a cluster. This profile starts the backend features for data processing and communicating with the manager node.</p>
</div></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Key Manager</td>
<td><pre><code>-Dprofile=api-key-manager</code></pre></td>
<td><div class="content-wrapper">

<p><br />
</p>
</div></td>
<td><div class="content-wrapper">
<p>Only starts the features relevant to the Traffic Manager component of the API Manager.</p>
<p>The Traffic Manager helps users to regulate API traffic, make APIs and applications available to consumers at different service levels, and secure APIs against security attacks. The Traffic Manager features a dynamic throttling engine to process throttling policies in real-time, including rate limiting of API requests.</p>

### Starting an API-M profile

You can start an API Manager profile in the following methods, based on your requirement

-   [Method 1- Optimizing before starting the server](#ProductProfiles-Method1-Optimizingbeforestartingtheserver)
-   [Method 2 - Optimizing while starting the server](#ProductProfiles-Method2-Optimizingwhilestartingtheserver)

!!! info
It is recommended to start the components in the following order: Key Manager, Publisher, Developer Portal, Traffic Manager, and Gateway.


#### Method 1- Optimizing before starting the server

Create an optimized distribution for a particular API-M profile.

1.  Run the `<PRODUCT_HOME>/bin/profileSetup.sh` script or `<PRODUCT_HOME>/bin/profileSetup.bat` script based on your operating system, with the profile flag.

    -   [**Sample commands**](#079827d8c1d84ff1819b83512255f00e)
    -   [**Example**](#94cb7f5f7ca345b38935a151bce7ade1)

    ``` java
        sh <PRODUCT_HOME>/bin/profileSetup.sh  -Dprofile=<preferred-profile>
    ```

    **Starting the Publisher profile**

    ``` java
            sh <PRODUCT_HOME>/bin/profileSetup.sh  -Dprofile=api-publisher 
    ```

2.  Start the server with the specified profile. A sample command is shown below.

    -   [**Sample commands**](#1caa2187ee11400988eed8f095bd6639)
    -   [**Example**](#9626a09cc8974d19b3c7ce86dfdb3ed4)

    ``` java
            sh <PRODUCT_HOME>/bin/wso2server.sh -Dprofile=<preferred-profile>
    ```

    **Starting the Publisher profile**

    ``` java
            sh <PRODUCT_HOME>/bin/wso2server.sh -Dprofile=api-publisher
    ```

#### Method 2 - Optimizing while starting the server

1.  Start the server using the script based on your operating system, using the command given below.

    -   [**Sample commands**](#8480e9325dec42eb82f98b679afa8816)
    -   [**Example**](#88dfa68c4bb148ac8afc74a1fd49607c)

    ``` java
            sh <PRODUCT_HOME>/bin/wso2server.sh --optimize -Dprofile=<preferred-profile>
    ```

    **Starting the Publisher profile**

    ``` java
            sh <PRODUCT_HOME>/bin/wso2server.sh --optimize -Dprofile=api-publisher
    ```

                Finished the optimizations
                Starting the server...
        ```

!!! note
    Note that registry indexing for the Traffic Manager and Gateway worker profiles are disabled when you run the profile optimization. To enable registry indexing, open the `<PRODUCT_HOME>/repository/conf/registry.xml` file. Set the value of the `<startIndexing>` parameter in the `<indexingConfiguration>` section to true as shown below.

    ``` java
        <indexingConfiguration>
        <startIndexing>true</startIndexing>
        . . .
        </indexingConfiguration>
    ```


### How multi-profiling works

Starting a product on a preferred profile starts only a subset of features bundled in the product. In order to identify what feature bundles apply to which profile, each product maintains a set of `bundles.info` files in the `<PRODUCT_HOME>/repository/components/<profile-name>/configuration/org.eclipse.equinox.simpleconfigurator` directories. The `bundles.info` files contain references to the actual bundles. Note that `<profile-name>` in the directory path refers to the name of the profile. For example, when there's a product profile named webapp, references to all the feature bundles required for webapp profile to function are in a `bundles.info` file saved in the `<PRODUCT_HOME>/repository/components/webapp/configuration/org.eclipse.equinox.simpleconfigurator` directory.

Note that when you start the server without using a preferred profile, the server refers to the `<PRODUCT_HOME>/repository/components/default/configuration/org.eclipse.equinox.simpleconfigurator/bundles.info` file by default. This file contains references to all bundles in the `<PRODUCT_HOME>/repository/components/plugins` directory, which is where all components/bundles of a product are saved.
