# Installing on Solaris

!!! note
    **Before you begin:**

    -   See [our compatibility matrix]({{base_path}}/InstallAndSetup/ProductCompatibility) to find out if this version of the product is fully tested on Solaris.


Follow the instructions below to install API Manager on Solaris.

### Installing the required applications

1.  Establish an SSH connection to the Solaris machine or log in on the text console.
2.  Be sure your system meets the Installation Prerequisites . Java Development Kit (JDK) is essential to run the product.

### Installing the API Manager

1.  [Download the latest version of WSO2 API Manager](https://wso2.com/api-management/).
2.  Extract the archive file to a dedicated directory for the API Manager, which will hereafter be referred to as `<API-M_HOME>`.

### Setting up JAVA\_HOME

You must set your `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to point to the directory where the Java Development Kit (JDK) is installed on the computer.

!!! info

    Environment variables are global system variables accessible by all the processes running under the operating system.


1.  In your home directory, open the BASHRC file in your favorite text editor, such as vi, emacs, pico, or mcedit.
2.  Assuming you have JDK 1.7.0\_80 in your system, add the following two lines at the bottom of the file, replacing `/usr/java/jdk1.7.0_80` with the actual directory where the JDK is installed.

    ``` java
    export JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/jdk1.7.0_80
    export PATH=${JAVA_HOME}/bin:${PATH}
    ```

    The file should now look like this:

    ![]({{base_path}}/assets/attachments/103334399/103334401.png)

3.  Save the file.

    !!! info
        
        If you do not know how to work with text editors in an SSH session, run the following command: `cat >> .bashrc          `

    Paste the string from the clipboard and press "Ctrl+D."


4.  To verify that the `JAVA_HOME` variable is set correctly, execute the following command:

    `echo $JAVA_HOME`

5.  The system returns the JDK installation path.

### Setting system properties

If you need to set additional system properties when the server starts, you can take the following approaches:

-   **Set the properties from a script** : Setting your system properties in the startup script is ideal, because it ensures that you set the properties every time you start the server. To avoid having to modify the script each time you upgrade, the best approach is to create your own startup script that wraps the WSO2 startup script and adds the properties you want to set, rather than editing the WSO2 startup script directly.
-   **Set the properties from an external registry** : If you want to access properties from an external registry, you could create Java code that reads the properties at runtime from that registry. Be sure to store sensitive data such as username and password to connect to the registry in a properties file instead of in the Java code and secure the properties file with the [secure vault]({{base_path}}/Administer/ProductSecurity/General/LoginsAndPasswords/admin-carbon-secure-vault-implementation).

You are now ready to [run the product]({{base_path}}/InstallAndSetup/InstallationGuide/running-the-product/).
