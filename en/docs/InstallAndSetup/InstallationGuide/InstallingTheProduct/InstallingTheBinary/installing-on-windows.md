# Installing on Windows

!!! note

    **Before you begin:**

    -   See [our compatibility matrix]({{base_path}}/InstallAndSetup/ProductCompatibility) to find out if this version of the product is fully tested on Windows.

Follow the instructions below to install API Manager on Windows.

## Installing the required applications

1.  Be sure your system meets the Installation Prerequisites. Java Development Kit (JDK) is essential to run the product.
2.  Be sure that the `PATH` environment variable is set to "C:\\Windows\\System32", because the `findstr` windows exe is stored in this path.

## Installing the API Manager

1.  [Download the latest version ofÂ WSO2 API Manager](https://wso2.com/api-management/).
2.  Extract the archive file to a dedicated directory for the API Manager, which will hereafter be referred to as `<API-M_HOME>`.

## Installing and setting up snappy-java

1.  Download the `snappy-java_1.1.1.7.jar` from [here](http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.xerial.snappy/snappy-java/1.1.1.7).
2.  Copy the jar to `<API-M_HOME>\repository\components\lib`.
3.  If the API Manager server is currently running, restart it to apply the changes.

## Setting up JAVA\_HOME

You must set your `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to point to the directory where the Java Development Kit (JDK) is installed on the computer. Typically, the JDK is installed in a directory under `C:/Program Files/Java` , such as `C:/Program Files/Java/jdk1.7.0_80` . If you have multiple versions installed, choose the latest one, which you can find by sorting by date.

!!! info

    Environment variables are global system variables accessible by all the processes running under the operating system. You can define an environment variable as a system variable, which applies to all users, or as a user variable, which applies only to the user who is currently logged in.


You set up `JAVA_HOME` using the System Properties, as described below. Alternatively, if you just want to set `JAVA_HOME` temporarily for the current command prompt window, [set it at the command prompt]({{base_path}}/InstallAndSetup/InstallationGuide/InstallingTheProduct/InstallingTheBinary/installing-on-windows/#setting-java95home-temporarily-using-the-windows-command-prompt-cmd).

### Setting up JAVA\_HOME using the system properties

1.  Right-click the **My Computer** icon on the desktop and click **Properties.**

    ![]({{base_path}}/assets/attachments/thumbnails/26838941/27042151)

2.  In the System Properties window, click the **Advanced** tab, and then click **Environment Variables**.

    ![](../../../../assets/attachments/26838941/27042150.png)

3.  Click **New** under **System variables** (for all users) or under **User variables** (just for the user who is currently logged in).

    ![]({{base_path}}/assets/attachments/thumbnails/26838941/27042154)

4.  Enter the following information:
    -   In the **Variable name** field, enter: `JAVA_HOME           `
    -   In the **Variable value** field, enter the installation path of the Java Development Kit, such as: `c:/Program Files/Javajdk1.7.0_80           `

The `JAVA_HOME` variable is now set and will apply to any subsequent command prompt windows you open. If you have existing command prompt windows running, you must close and reopen them for the `JAVA_HOME` variable to take effect, or manually set the `JAVA_HOME` variable in those command prompt windows as described in the next section. To verify that the `JAVA_HOME` variable is set correctly, open a command window (from the **Start** menu, click **Run**, and then type `CMD` and click **Enter** ) and execute the following command:

`set JAVA_HOME`

The system returns the JDK installation path. You are now ready to [run the product]({{base_path}}/InstallAndSetup/InstallationGuide/running-the-product/).

### Setting JAVA\_HOME temporarily using the Windows command prompt (CMD)

You can temporarily set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable within a Windows command prompt window (CMD). This is useful when you have an existing command prompt window running and you do not want to restart it.

1.  In the command prompt window, enter the following command where `<JDK_INSTALLATION_PATH>` is the JDK installation directory and press **Enter.**

    `set JAVA_HOME=<JDK_INSTALLATION_PATH>`

    For example: `set JAVA_HOME=c:/Program Files/java/jdk1.7.0_80          `

    The `JAVA_HOME` variable is now set for the current CMD session only.

2.  To verify that the `JAVA_HOME` variable is set correctly, execute the following command:

    `set JAVA_HOME`

3.  The system returns the JDK installation path.

## Setting system properties

If you need to set additional system properties when the server starts, you can take the following approaches:

-   **Set the properties from a script** : Setting your system properties in the startup script is ideal, because it ensures that you set the properties every time you start the server. To avoid having to modify the script each time you upgrade, the best approach is to create your own startup script that wraps the WSO2 startup script and adds the properties you want to set, rather than editing the WSO2 startup script directly.
-   **Set the properties from an external registry** : If you want to access properties from an external registry, you could create Java code that reads the properties at runtime from that registry. Be sure to store sensitive data such as username and password to connect to the registry in a properties file instead of in the Java code and secure the properties file with the [secure vault]({{base_path}}/Administer/ProductSecurity/General/LoginsAndPasswords/admin-carbon-secure-vault-implementation).

You are now ready to [run the product]({{base_path}}/InstallAndSetup/InstallationGuide/running-the-product/).
