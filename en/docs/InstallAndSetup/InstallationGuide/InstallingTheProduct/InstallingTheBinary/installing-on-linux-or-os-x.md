# Installing on Linux or OS X

!!! note

    **Before you begin:**

    -   See [our compatibility matrix]({{base_path}}/InstallAndSetup/ProductCompatibility) to find out if this version of the product is fully tested on Linux or OS X.

Follow the instructions below to install API Manager on Linux or Mac OS X.

### Installing the required applications

1.  Log in to the command line (Terminal on Mac).
2.  Ensure that your system meets the [Installation Prerequisites]({{base_path}}/InstallAndSetup/InstallationGuide/installation-prerequisites). Java Development Kit (JDK) is essential to run the product.

### Installing the API Manager

1.  [Download the latest version of WSO2 API Manager](https://wso2.com/api-management/).
2.  Extract the archive file to a dedicated directory for the API Manager, which will hereafter be referred to as `<API-M_HOME>`.

### Setting up JAVA\_HOME

You must set your `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to point to the directory where the Java Development Kit (JDK) is installed on the computer.

!!! info

    Environment variables are global system variables accessible by all the processes running under the operating system.


1.  In your home directory, open the BASHRC file (.bash\_profile file  on Mac) using editors such as vi, emacs, pico, or mcedit.
2.  Assuming you have JDK 1.7.0\_80 in your system, add the following two lines at the bottom of the file, replacing `/usr/java/jdk1.7.0_80` with the actual directory where the JDK is installed.

    ``` java
    On Linux:
    export JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/jdk1.7.0_80
    export PATH=${JAVA_HOME}/bin:${PATH}
         
    On OS X:
    export JAVA_HOME=/System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.7.0.jdk/Contents/Home
    ```

3.  Save the file.

    !!! info
    
        If you do not know how to work with text editors in a Linux SSH session, run the following command: `cat >> .bashrc.` Paste the string from the clipboard and press "Ctrl+D."


4.  To verify that the `JAVA_HOME` variable is set correctly, execute the following command:

5.  The system returns the JDK installation path.

``` java
On Linux:
echo $JAVA_HOME
     
On OS X:
which java
If the above command gives you a path like /usr/bin/java, then it is a symbolic link to the real location. To get the real location, run the following:
ls -l `which java`
```
### Setting system properties

If you need to set additional system properties when the server starts, you can take the following approaches:

-   **Set the properties from a script** : Setting your system properties in the startup script is ideal, because it ensures that you set the properties every time you start the server. To avoid having to modify the script each time you upgrade, the best approach is to create your own startup script that wraps the WSO2 startup script and adds the properties you want to set, rather than editing the WSO2 startup script directly.
-   **Set the properties from an external registry** : If you want to access properties from an external registry, you could create Java code that reads the properties at runtime from that registry. Be sure to store sensitive data such as username and password to connect to the registry in a properties file instead of in the Java code and secure the properties file with the [secure vault](https://docs.wso2.com/display/ADMIN44x/Carbon+Secure+Vault+Implementation).

!!! info

    When using SUSE Linux, it ignores `/etc/resolv.conf` and only looks at the `/etc/hosts` file. This means that the server will throw an exception on startup if you have not specified anything besides localhost. To avoid this error, add the following line above `127.0.0.1 localhost` in the `/etc/hosts` file: `<ip_address><machine_name> localhost`

You are now ready to [run the product]({{base_path}}/InstallAndSetup/InstallationGuide/running-the-product/).
