# Product Startup Options

Given below are the options that are available when starting a WSO2 product. The product startup scripts are stored in the `<PRODUCT_HOME>/bin/` directory. When you execute the startup script, you canÂ pass a system property by appending it next to the start-up script as shown below.

``` java
    sh wso2server.sh -<startup option>
```

For example:

``` java
    ./wso2server.sh -Dsetup (In Linux)
    wso2server.bat -Dsetup (In Windows)
```

Listed below are some general options that can be used for starting the server.
