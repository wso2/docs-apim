# Changing to IBM DB2

By default, WSO2 API Manager uses the embedded H2 database as the database for storing user management and registry data. Given below are the steps you need to follow in order to use IBM DB2 for this purpose.

## Setting up IBM DB2

The following sections describe how to set up a IBM DB2 database to replace the default H2 database in your WSO2 product:

- [Setting up the database and users](#setting-up-the-database-and-users)
- [Setting up the drivers](#setting-up-the-drivers)
- [Executing db scripts to create tables on IBM DB2 database](#executing-db-scripts-to-create-tables-on-ibm-db2-database)

### Setting up the database and users

Follow the steps below to set up a IBM DB2 database:

1. Create the database using the following command:
   ```sh
   $ db2 CREATE DATABASE <DATABASE_NAME>
   ```

1. Before issuing an SQL statement, establish the connection to the database using the following command:
   ```sh
   $ db2 CONNECT TO <DATABASE_NAME> user <USER_NAME> using <PASSWORD>
   ```

1. Grant required permissions for users as follows:
   ```sh
   $ db2 <AUTHORITY> ON DATABASE TO USER <USER_NAME>
   ```
   For example:
   ```sh
   $ db2 GRANT DBADM, CREATETAB, BINDADD, CONNECT, CREATE_NOT_FENCED, IMPLICIT_SCHEMA, LOAD ON DATABASE TO USER regadmin
   ```

1. Disconnect from the database using the following command:
   ```sh
   $ db2 DISCONNECT CURRENT
   ```

### Setting up the drivers

1. Unzip the WSO2 API Manager pack. Let's call it `<API-M_HOME>`.

2. Download the [IBM DB2 JDBC driver](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/db2-jdbc-driver-versions-and-downloads).

3. Copy it to the `<API-M_HOME>/repository/components/lib/` directory in all the nodes of the cluster.

### Executing db scripts to create tables on IBM DB2 database

1. To create tables in the registry and user manager database (`WSO2_SHARED_DB`), execute the relevant script as shown below.
   ```sh
   $ db2 CONNECT TO <DATABASE_NAME> user <USER_NAME> using <PASSWORD>
   $ db2 -td/ -vmf '<API-M_HOME>/dbscripts/db2.sql';
   ```

1. To create tables in the apim database (`WSO2AM_DB`), execute the relevant script as shown below.
   ```sh
   $ db2 CONNECT TO <DATABASE_NAME> user <USER_NAME> using <PASSWORD>
   $ db2 -td/ -vmf '<API-M_HOME>/dbscripts/apimgt/db2.sql';
   ```

## Changing to IBM DB2

- [Creating the datasource connection to IBM DB2](#creating-the-datasource-connection-to-ibm-db2)

### Creating the datasource connection to IBM DB2

A datasource is used to establish the connection to a database. By default, `WSO2_SHARED_DB` and `WSO2AM_DB` datasource are configured in the `deployment.toml` file for the purpose of connecting to the default H2 databases.

After setting up the IBM DB2 database to replace the default H2 database, either change the default configurations of the `WSO2_SHARED_DB` and `WSO2AM_DB` datasource, or configure a new datasource to point it to the new database as explained below.

!!! note
    **If you are configuring API-M in a distributed setup** , do the changes in all the WSO2 API-M components.

Follow the steps below to change the type of the default datasource.

1.  Open the `<API-M_HOME>/repository/conf/deployment.toml` configuration file and locate the `[database.shared_db]` and `[database.apim_db]` configuration elements.

1.  You simply have to update the URL pointing to your MySQL database, the username, and password required to access the database and the MySQL driver details as shown below.

    | Element                       | Description                                                                                                |
        |-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
        | **type**                      | The database type used                                                                                     |
        | **url**                       | The URL of the database. The default port for IBM DB2 is 50000                                             |
        | **username** and **password** | The name and password of the database user                                                                 |
        | **driverClassName**           | The class name of the database driver                                                                      |
        | **validationQuery**           | The SQL query that will be used to validate connections from this pool before returning them to the caller.|

    Sample configuration is shown below:

    ``` tab="Format"
    type = "db2"
    url = "jdbc:db2://localhost:50000/<DATABASE_NAME>"
    username = "<USER_NAME>"
    password = "<PASSWORD>"
    driver = "com.ibm.db2.jcc.DB2Driver"
    validationQuery = "SELECT 1 FROM SYSIBM.SYSDUMMY1"
    ```

    ``` tab="Example"
    [database.shared_db]
    type = "db2"
    url = "jdbc:db2://localhost:50000/apim_db"
    username = "apimadmin"
    password = "apimadmin"
    driver = "com.ibm.db2.jcc.DB2Driver"
    validationQuery = "SELECT 1 FROM SYSIBM.SYSDUMMY1"
    
    [database.apim_db]
    type = "db2"
    url = "jdbc:db2://localhost:50000/reg_db"
    username = "regadmin"
    password = "regadmin"
    driver = "com.ibm.db2.jcc.DB2Driver"
    validationQuery = "SELECT 1 FROM SYSIBM.SYSDUMMY1"
    ```

1.  You can update the configuration elements given below for your database connection.

    | Element                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
    |------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | **maxActive**          | The maximum number of active connections that can be allocated at the same time from this pool. Enter any negative value to denote an unlimited number of active connections.                                                                                                                                                                |
    | **maxWait**            | The maximum number of milliseconds that the pool will wait (when there are no available connections) for a connection to be returned before throwing an exception. You can enter zero or a negative value to wait indefinitely.                                                                                                              |
    | **minIdle**            | The minimum number of active connections that can remain idle in the pool without extra ones being created, or enter zero to create none.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
    | **testOnBorrow**       | The indication of whether objects will be validated before being borrowed from the pool. If the object fails to validate, it will be dropped from the pool, and another attempt will be made to borrow another.                                                                                                                              |
    | **validationInterval** | The indication to avoid excess validation, and only run validation at the most, at this frequency (time in milliseconds). If a connection is due for validation but has been validated previously within this interval, it will not be validated again.                                                                                      |
    | **defaultAutoCommit**  | This property is **not** applicable to the Carbon database in WSO2 products because auto committing is usually handled at the code level, i.e., the default auto commit configuration specified for the RDBMS driver will be effective instead of this property element. Typically, auto committing is enabled for RDBMS drivers by default. When auto committing is enabled, each SQL statement will be committed to the database as an individual transaction, as opposed to committing multiple statements as a single transaction.|                                                              
    | **commitOnReturn**     | If `defaultAutoCommit =false`, then you can set `commitOnReturn =true`, so that the pool can complete the transaction by calling the commit on the connection as it is returned to the pool. However, If `rollbackOnReturn =true` then this attribute is ignored. The default value is false.|
    | **rollbackOnReturn**   | If `defaultAutoCommit =false`, then you can set `rollbackOnReturn =true` so that the pool can terminate the transaction by calling rollback on the connection as it is returned to the pool. The default value is false.|

    Sample configuration is shown below:
    
    ``` tab="Format"
    type = "db2"
    url = "jdbc:db2://localhost:50000/<DATABASE_NAME>"
    username = "<USER_NAME>"
    password = "<PASSWORD>"
    driver = "com.ibm.db2.jcc.DB2Driver"
    validationQuery = "SELECT 1 FROM SYSIBM.SYSDUMMY1"
    pool_options.<OPTION-1> = <VALUE-1>
    pool_options.<OPTION-2> = <VALUE-2>
    ...
    ```

    ``` tab="Example"
    [database.shared_db]
    type = "db2"
    url = "jdbc:db2://localhost:50000/apim_db"
    username = "apimadmin"
    password = "apimadmin"
    driver = "com.ibm.db2.jcc.DB2Driver"
    validationQuery = "SELECT 1 FROM SYSIBM.SYSDUMMY1"
    pool_options.maxActive = 100
    pool_options.maxWait = 10000
    pool_options.validationInterval = 10000

    [database.apim_db]
    type = "db2"
    url = "jdbc:db2://localhost:50000/reg_db"
    username = "regadmin"
    password = "regadmin"
    driver = "com.ibm.db2.jcc.DB2Driver"
    validationQuery = "SELECT 1 FROM SYSIBM.SYSDUMMY1"
    pool_options.maxActive = 50
    pool_options.maxWait = 30000
    ```

1.  Restart the server.
