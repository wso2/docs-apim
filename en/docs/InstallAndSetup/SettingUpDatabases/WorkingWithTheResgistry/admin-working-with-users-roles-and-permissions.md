# Working with Users, Roles and Permissions

The user management functionality allows you to configure the users that can access your product and the permissions that determine how each user can work with your system.

The default user management configuration in a WSO2 product is as follows:

-   The default H2 database in the WSO2 product is configured as the User Store that stores all the information on users, roles and permissions.
-   An **Admin** user and **Admin** password are configured by default.
-   The default **Admin** role connected to the **Admin** user has all permissions granted.

According to the default configuration explained above, you can simply log into the management console of the product with the **Admin** user and get started right away.
