# Moesif Analytics Integration Guide

This guide outlines the steps required to integrate **Moesif Analytics** with **WSO2 API Manager**. The integration enables you to collect and publish API analytics data to the **Moesif dashboard**, providing insights into API usage, traffic trends, and error tracking.

### Analytics Data Flow

The Moesif integration captures both **successful** and **failed** API invocations in WSO2 API Manager and publishes them to your Moesif dashboard in near real-time. This allows for powerful analytics and monitoring capabilities.

This section will cover necessary steps to integrate Moesif analytics with WSO2 API Manager.

### Step 1: Set Up Your Moesif Account

#### 1.1 Create an Account and Log In

1. Go to [Moesif’s official website](https://www.moesif.com/)  
2. Sign up for a new account or log in to your existing account.

#### 1.2 Create a New Application

1. Once logged in, create a **new App** from the “Get Started” page.  
2. Follow the setup steps and click **Next**.  
3. You’ll be presented with an **Application ID**. Copy this ID as it will be used in the WSO2 configuration.

!!! note
    For more detailed instructions and advanced configuration options, refer to the official [Moesif Documentation](https://www.moesif.com/docs).

### Step 2 - Configure WSO2 API Manager

To enable Moesif analytics in WSO2 APIM, you need to update the `deployment.toml` configuration file.

#### Step 2.1 - Configuring the deployment.toml file.

The Choreo based analytics will be enabled by default. Specify the `type` as `moesif` to enable Moesif analytics as shown below. Open the `<APIM-HOME>/repository/conf` directory. Edit the `apim.analyics` configuration in the `deployment.toml` file with the following configuration.

```toml
[apim.analytics]
enable = true
type = "moesif"
properties."moesifKey" = "<your-moesif-application-id>"
properties."publisher.reporter.class" = "org.wso2.am.analytics.publisher.reporter.moesif.MoesifReporter"
logger.reporter.level = "INFO"
```

!!! important
    Here replace the `<your-moesif-application-id>` with the actual Application ID copied from Step 1.2.

!!! note
    Following are the details that are available on analytics log events: 

    `apim_event_response` -  This event will be triggered for each successful API invocation. When a API associated backend returns an error    response still it will be logged through this event.

    ```
    apim_event_response:

### Real Time Analytics

Once the Moesif integration is configured, you can view real-time analytics on the Moesif dashboard. The dashboard provides insights into API related details mention in the above section.

!!! note
    The Moesif dashboard allows you to filter and segment data based on various parameters such as API, user, application, and more. This enables you to gain deeper insights into API usage patterns and performance.

!!! note
    If you invoke AI APIs, you can also view AI API related analytics such as model, vendor name, token usage and more in the Moesif dashboard. The following image illustrates the AI API related analytics.

### Dashboards

Users can create a variety of dashboards in Moesif using the analytics data published from the WSO2 API Gateway. The sample dashboard below illustrates API usage segmented by different users.
