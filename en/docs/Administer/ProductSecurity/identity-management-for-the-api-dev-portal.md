-   [Password Recovery]({{base_path}}/Administer/ProductSecurity/identity-management-for-the-api-dev-portal/#password-recovery)
-   [Account locking]({{base_path}}/Administer/ProductSecurity/identity-management-for-the-api-dev-portal/#account-locking)
-   [Password policies]({{base_path}}/Administer/ProductSecurity/identity-management-for-the-api-dev-portal/#Password-policies)

### Password Recovery

Password recovery feature does not work by default because an email server is not configured to send the password recovery email. Follow the steps below to enable password recovery feature for the API Developer Portal.

1.  Open the `<API-M_HOME>/repository/conf/deployment.toml` file and add a mail server configuration as shown below. See [Configuring the Email Sending Module](https://is.docs.wso2.com/en/5.9.0/setup/configuring-email-sending/) for more information.

    ``` java
        [output_adapter.email]
        from_address = "wso2am@gmail.com"
        username = "wso2amtest"
        password = "Wso2@am70"
        hostname = "smtp.gmail.com"
        port = "587"
        enable_start_tls = true
        enable_authentication = true
    ```

2.  After the mail server is configured, the user can click on the **Forgot Password** link on the Sign In page of the API Developer Portal and request a password change.
    
    ![signin-forgot-password-link]({{base_path}}/assets/img/Administer/ProductSecurity/identity-management-for-the-api-dev-portal/forgot-password.png)

3.  Enter the username you are trying to recover the password of and click **Submit**.
   
    ![password-recovery-page]({{base_path}}/assets/img/Administer/ProductSecurity/identity-management-for-the-api-dev-portal/password-recovery-form.png )

4.  You will receive an email with instructions to reset your password. Note that this is email is sent to the email address stored during user sign up.

    !!! note
        You can change the the template of this email (E.g., email link, message body, etc.). To edit the mail template, open the `<API-M_HOME>/repository/conf/email/email-admin-config.xml` file and make the changes.

### Account locking

You can lock user accounts with the Account recovery and credential management feature, pre-installed in WSO2 API Manager.

### Password policies

You can define custom password policies for API developer portal user signup. Open the `<API-M_HOME>/repository/conf/deployment.toml` file and add the password policy configuration based on your preference as shown below. See [Writing a Custom Password Validator](https://is.docs.wso2.com/en/5.9.0/develop/writing-a-custom-password-validator/) for more information.

``` java
    [identity_mgt.events.schemes]
    passwordPolicy.properties.enable = true
    passwordPolicy.properties.'min.length' = 4
    passwordPolicy.properties.'max.length' = 10
    passwordPolicy.properties.pattern = "^((?=.*\\\\d)(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*[!@#$%&*])).{0,100}$"
    passwordPolicy.properties.errorMsg = "Password pattern policy violated. Password should contain a digit[0-9], a lower case letter[a-z], an upper case letter[A-Z], one of !@#$%&* characters"
    passwordPolicy.properties.'class.PasswordLengthPolicy' = "org.wso2.carbon.identity.mgt.policy.password.DefaultPasswordLengthPolicy"
    passwordPolicy.properties.'class.PasswordNamePolicy' = "org.wso2.carbon.identity.mgt.policy.password.DefaultPasswordNamePolicy"
    passwordPolicy.properties.'class.PasswordPatternPolicy' = "org.wso2.carbon.identity.mgt.policy.password.DefaultPasswordPatternPolicy"
```
