# Default Product Ports

This page describes the default ports that are used for each WSO2 product when the [port offset](_Changing_the_Default_Ports_with_Offset_) is 0.

!!! warning
    **Note** that it is recommended to disable the HTTP transport in an API Manager production setup. Using the `Bearer` token over HTTP is a violation of the OAuth specification and can lead to security vulnerabilities.


-   [Product-specific ports](#product-specific-ports)
-   [Disabling HTTP Transports](#disabling-http-transports)

#### Common ports

The following ports are common to all WSO2 products that provide the given feature. Some features are bundled in the WSO2 Carbon platform itself and therefore are available in all WSO2 products by default.

[Common ports](#common-ports) | [Management console ports](#management-console-ports) | [LDAP server ports](#ldap-server-ports) | [KDC ports](#kdc-ports) | [JMX monitoring ports](#jmx-monitoring-ports) | [Clustering ports](#clustering-ports) | [Random ports](#random-ports)

#### Management console ports

WSO2 products that provide a management console use the following servlet transport ports:

-   9443 - HTTPS servlet transport (the default URL of the management console is https://localhost:9443/carbon )
-   9763 - HTTP servlet transport

WSO2 API Manager (WSO2 APIM) uses the following ports to access the management console:

-   9443 - HTTPS servlet transport for the **APIM** runtime (the default URL of the management console is https://localhost:9443/carbon )
-   9444 - Used for the **APIM-Analytics** management console

#### LDAP server ports

Provided by default in the WSO2 Carbon platform.

-   10389 - Used in WSO2 products that provide an embedded LDAP server

#### KDC ports

-   8000 - Used to expose the Kerberos key distribution center server

#### JMX monitoring ports

WSO2 Carbon platform uses TCP ports to monitor a running Carbon instance using a JMX client such as JConsole. By default, JMX is enabled in all products. You can disable it by adding following configuration to `<PRODUCT_HOME>/repository/conf/deployment.toml` file.

``` java
    [monitoring.jmx]
    rmi_server_start = false
```

-   11111 - RMIRegistry port. Used to monitor Carbon remotely
-   9999 - RMIServer port. Used along with the RMIRegistry port when Carbon is monitored from a JMX client that is behind a firewall

#### Clustering ports

To cluster any running Carbon instance, either one of the following ports must be opened.

-   45564 - Opened if the membership scheme is multicast
-   4000 - Opened if the membership scheme is wka

#### Random ports

Certain ports are randomly opened during server startup. This is due to specific properties and configurations that become effective when the product is started. Note that the IDs of these random ports will change every time the server is started.

-   A random TCP port will open at server startup because of the `-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote` property is set in the server startup script. This property is used for the JMX monitoring facility in JVM.
-   A random UDP port is opened at server startup due to the log4j appender ( `SyslogAppender` ), which is configured in the `<PRODUCT_HOME>/repository/conf/log4j.properties` file.

### Product-specific ports

Some products open additional ports.

##### Enterprise Mobility Manager

The following ports need to be opened for Android and iOS devices so that it can connect to Google Cloud Messaging (GCM)/Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) and APNS (Apple Push Notification Service) and enroll to WSO2 EMM.

Android:
The ports to open are 5228, 5229 and 5230. GCM/FCM typically only uses 5228, but it sometimes uses 5229 and 5230.
GCM/FCM does not provide specific IPs, so it is recommended to allow the firewall to accept outgoing connections to all IP addresses contained in the IP blocks listed in Google's ASN of 15169.

iOS:

-   5223 - TCP port used by devices to communicate to APNs servers
-   2195 - TCP port used to send notifications to APNs
-   2196 - TCP port  used by the APNs feedback service
-   443 - TCP port used as a fallback on Wi-Fi, only when devices are unable to communicate to APNs on port 5223
    The APNs servers use load balancing. The devices will not always connect to the same public IP address for notifications. The entire 17.0.0.0/8 address block is assigned to Apple, so it is best to allow this range in the firewall settings.

API Manager:

!!! info
    The following WSO2 API Manager ports are only applicable to WSO2 EMM 1.1.0 onwards.


-   10397 - Thrift client and server ports
-   8280, 8243 - NIO/PT transport ports

##### IoT Server

The following ports need to be opened for WSO2 IoT Server, and Android and iOS devices so that it can connect to Google Cloud Messaging (GCM)/Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) and APNS (Apple Push Notification Service), and enroll to WSO2 IoT Server.

### Disabling HTTP Transports

API Manager has two HTTP transports. See below for instructions on how to disable the following:

1.  Passthru (API Traffic) Transport
2.  Servlet (UI Traffic and Admin service access) Transport

##### Disabling Passthrough Transport

1.  Open the `<API-M_HOME>/repository/conf/axis2/axis2.xml` file.
2.  Locate the Transport receiver http as shown below:

    **HTTP Transport Receiver**

    ``` xml
        <transportReceiver name="http" class="org.apache.synapse.transport.passthru.PassThroughHttpListener">
            ...     
        </transportReceiver>
    ```

3.  Comment out the http transport receiver section.

##### Disabling Servlet Transport

1.  Open the `<API-M_HOME>/repository/conf/tomcat/catalina-server.xml` file.
2.  Locate the Connector with the port 9763 as shown below:

    **HTTP Transport Receiver**

    ``` xml
            <Connector protocol="org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11NioProtocol" port="9763"
                ...
            />
    ```

3.  Comment out the http connector section.

!!! note
The Server needs to be restarted for these changes to be effective.
