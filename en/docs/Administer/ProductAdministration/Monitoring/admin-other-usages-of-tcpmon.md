#### Sending Requests for Web Services

TCPMon can also be used as a request sender for Web services. The request SOAP message can be pasted on the send screen and sent directly to the server.

#### As a Proxy

TCPMon can act as a proxy. To start it in proxy mode, select the Proxy option. When acting as a proxy, TCPMon only needs the listener port to be configured.

#### Advanced Settings

TCPMon can simulate a slow connection, in which case the delay and the bytes to be dropped can be configured. This is useful when testing Web services.

Also, if HTTP proxy support is required, that can also be set on the admin screen.
