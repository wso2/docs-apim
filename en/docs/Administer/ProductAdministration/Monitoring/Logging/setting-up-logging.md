# Setting up logging in API Manager

Logging is one of the most important aspects of a production-grade server. A properly configured logging system is vital for identifying errors, security threats, and usage patterns.

WSO2 API Manager uses various types of logs to track realtime internal and external activities. Separate log files are created for each of those log types in the `<APIM_HOME>/repository/logs` directory. Following illustrates the log types supported by the APIM and how those logs can be configured.

##Carbon Logs

WSO2 API Manager is shipped with log4j2 logging capabilities which generate logs for administrative and server-side activities. By default, carbon logs are persisted in `wso2carbon.log` which is located in `<APIM_HOME>/repository/logs` directory. You can configure the details that are captured in this log file by configuring the `<APIM_HOME>/repository/conf/log4j2.properties`.

!!!Java logging and Log4j integration
    In addition to the logs from libraries that use Log4j, all logs from libraries such as, Tomcat and Hazelcast that use Java logging framework are also visible in the same log files. That is, when Java logging is enabled in Carbon, only the Log4j appenders will write to the log files. If the Java Logging Handlers have logs, these logs will be delegated to the log events of the corresponding Log4j appenders. A Pub/Sub registry pattern implementation has been used in the latter mentioned scenario to plug the handlers and appenders. 
    
###Configuring Carbon logs

Following is the default configuration for carbon logs and the default values can be changed by manually updating log4j2.properties file.

     ```
     appender.CARBON_LOGFILE.type = RollingFile
     appender.CARBON_LOGFILE.name = CARBON_LOGFILE
     appender.CARBON_LOGFILE.fileName = ${sys:carbon.home}/repository/logs/wso2carbon.log
     appender.CARBON_LOGFILE.filePattern = ${sys:carbon.home}/repository/logs/wso2carbon-%d{MM-dd-yyyy}.log
     appender.CARBON_LOGFILE.layout.type = PatternLayout
     appender.CARBON_LOGFILE.layout.pattern = TID: [%tenantId] [%appName] [%d] %5p {% raw %}{%c}{% endraw %} - %m%ex%n
     appender.CARBON_LOGFILE.policies.type = Policies
     appender.CARBON_LOGFILE.policies.time.type = TimeBasedTriggeringPolicy
     appender.CARBON_LOGFILE.policies.time.interval = 1
     appender.CARBON_LOGFILE.policies.time.modulate = true
     appender.CARBON_LOGFILE.policies.size.type = SizeBasedTriggeringPolicy
     appender.CARBON_LOGFILE.policies.size.size=10MB
     appender.CARBON_LOGFILE.strategy.type = DefaultRolloverStrategy
     appender.CARBON_LOGFILE.strategy.max = 20
     appender.CARBON_LOGFILE.filter.threshold.type = ThresholdFilter
     appender.CARBON_LOGFILE.filter.threshold.level = DEBUG

     appenders = CARBON_LOGFILE, CARBON_CONSOLE, AUDIT_LOGFILE, ATOMIKOS_LOGFILE, CARBON_TRACE_LOGFILE, CARBON_MEMORY, 
     DELETE_EVENT_LOGFILE, TRANSACTION_LOGFILE
     ```
   
   The log growth of carbon logs can be managed by the configurations discussed in [Managing log growth]({{base_path}}/Administer/ProductAdministration/Monitoring/Logging/managing-log-growth) guide.
   
###Enable Logs for a Component

Please follow below steps to enable logs for a given service component available in WSO2 API Manager.

1.  Open `APIM_HOME>/repository/conf/log4j2.properties` file.
2.  Add a new logger specifying the component name that you need to enable logs and the [log level](#setting-the-log-levels) as shown below.

    ``` tab="Format"
    logger.<Logger_Name>.name = <Component_name>
    logger.<Logger_Name>.level = <Log_level>
    ```

    ``` tab="Example"
    logger.org-wso2-carbon-user-core.name = org.wso2.carbon.user.core
    logger.org-wso2-carbon-user-core.level = DEBUG
    ```

3.  Append the newly added logger name to `loggers` configuration which is a comma separated list of all active loggers.

    ``` tab="Format"
    loggers = <Logger_Name>, trace-messages, org-apache-coyote,com-hazelcast
    ```

    ``` tab="Example"
    loggers = org-wso2-carbon-user-core, trace-messages, org-apache-coyote,com-hazelcast
    ```

###Setting the Log levels

The log level can be set specifically for each appender in the `log4j2.properties` file by setting the threshold value. If a log level is not specifically given for an appender as explained below, the root log level (INFO) will apply to all appenders by default.

For example, shown below is how the log level is set to DEBUG for the `CARBON_LOGFILE` appender:

```bash
appender.CARBON_LOGFILE.filter.threshold.level = DEBUG
```

Listed below are the log levels that can be configured:

| Level | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|-------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| OFF   | The highest possible log level. This is intended for disabling logging.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| FATAL | Indicates server errors that cause premature termination. These logs are expected to be immediately visible on the command line that you used for starting the server.                                                                                                          |
| ERROR | Indicates other runtime errors or unexpected conditions. These logs are expected to be immediately visible on the command line that you used for starting the server.                                                                                                           |
| WARN  | Indicates the use of deprecated APIs, poor use of API, possible errors, and other runtime situations that are undesirable or unexpected but not necessarily wrong. These logs are expected to be immediately visible on the command line that you used for starting the server. |
| INFO  | Indicates important runtime events, such as server startup/shutdown. These logs are expected to be immediately visible on the command line that you used for starting the server . It is recommended to keep these logs to a minimum.                                           |
| DEBUG | Provides detailed information on the flow through the system. This information is expected to be written to logs only. Generally, most lines logged by your application should be written as DEBUG logs.                                                                        |
| TRACE | Provides additional details on the behavior of events and services. This information is expected to be written to logs only.          

##Gateway Wire Logs

Gateway wire logs can be configure to monitor the HTTP message flow through API Gateway. Wire logs allow you to track the request headers, request payloads, response headers, response payloads etc of incoming and outgoing http traffic. 

!!!Warning
    Please note that wire logs should be enabled for troubleshooting purposes only. It is not recommended to run production systems with wire logs enabled.
    
In order to read the wire logs, you must first identify message direction.

<table>
    <tr>
        <td><b>DEBUG - wire >></b></td>
        <td>Represents the message coming into the API Gateway from the wire.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>DEBUG - wire <<</b></td>
        <td>Represents the message that goes to the wire from the API Gateway.</td>
    </tr>
</table>  

In a single roundtrip of a API request/response, you can observe following message flows via the wire log.

-   Incoming request to API gateway from API client (>>).
-   Outgoing request from API gateway to actual backend (<<).
-   Incoming response from actual backend to API gateway (>>).
-   Outgoing response from API gateway to API client (<<).

Following is a sample of gateway wire log for an API request.

###Enable Gateway wire logs

1.  Open `APIM_HOME>/repository/conf/log4j2.properties` file.
2.  You will be able to find `synapse-wire` logger which is already defined in default `log4j2.properties` file.

    ``` 
    logger.synapse-wire.name = org.apache.synapse.transport.http.wire
    logger.synapse-wire.level = DEBUG
    ```

    The `synapse-headers` logger can be used to log request and response headers only.
    
    ``` 
    logger.synapse-headers.name = org.apache.synapse.transport.http.headers
    logger.synapse-headers.level = DEBUG
    ```
 
3.  Append the `synapse-wire` logger name to `loggers` configuration which is a comma separated list of all active loggers. 

    ```
    loggers = synapse-wire, trace-messages, org-apache-coyote,com-hazelcast
    ```

    If you want to activate the wire logs only for message headers, you can activate `synapse-headers` logger.

    ```
    loggers = synapse-headers, trace-messages, org-apache-coyote,com-hazelcast
    ```
4.  Observe the logs for incoming and outgoing traffic in `<APIM_HOME>/repository/wso2carbon.log` file.

##HTTP Access Logs
HTTP requests/responses are logged in access logs to monitor the activities related to an application's usage. Please see [Monitoring HTTP Access Logs]({{base_path}}/Administer/ProductAdministration/Monitoring/Logging/monitoring-http-access-logs/) for instructions on how to configure and use HTTP access logs in WSO2 API Manager.

##Audit Logs
Audit logs are used for tracking the sequence of actions that affect a particular task carried out on the server. Please see [Monitoring Audit Logs]({{base_path}}/Administer/ProductAdministration/Monitoring/Logging/monitoring-audit-logs/) for instructions on how to configure and use audit logs in WSO2 API Manager.
