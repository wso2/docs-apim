# Monitoring Performance Statistics

WSO2 products provide a range of performance statistics on a running Carbon instance. These statistics include information about memory availability, request count, server name, server start time, system up time, active services, total memory, average, minimum, maximum response times etc. Statistics are accessible through the management console of a running Carbon instance.

Access and performance statistics are available in system level as follows:

### System-Level Statistics

Follow the instructions given below to access system-level statistics.

1.  Log in to the management console and click **System Statistics** in the **Monitor** tab:

    The following information is available:
    -   [Service Summary](#MonitoringPerformanceStatistics-ServiceSummary)
    -   [Server Information](#MonitoringPerformanceStatistics-ServerInformation)
    -   [Response Time Graph](#MonitoringPerformanceStatistics-ResponseTimeGraph)
    -   [Memory Graph](#MonitoringPerformanceStatistics-MemoryGraph)
    -   [Statistics Configuration Panel](#MonitoringPerformanceStatistics-StatisticsConfigurationPanel)

#### Service Summary

This panel provides the following information:

-   **Average Response Time** - The average amount of time taken by the mediation channel to mediate a message (in milliseconds).
-   **Minimum Response Time** - The least amount of time taken by the mediation channel to mediate a message (in milliseconds).
-   **Maximum Response Time** - The most amount of time taken by the mediation channel to mediate a message (in milliseconds).
-   **Total Request Count -** The total number of messages received and mediated through the mediation channel.
-   **Total Response Count -** The total number of messages sent and mediated through the mediation channel.
-   **Total Fault Count -** The number of messages that triggered faults while being mediated through the channel.
-   **Active Services** - The number of currently active services.

#### Server Information

This panel provides the following information:

-   **Host** - Shows the IP address of the server.
-   **Server Start Time** - Shows the time when the server started.
-   **System Up Time** - Shows the time the server has been up and running.
-   **Memory Allocated** - Shows the memory capacity of the server.
-   **Memory Usage** - Shows the used memory of the server.

#### Response Time Graph

This graph shows the temporal variation of the server Memory.

#### Statistics Configuration Panel

The **Statistics Configuration** panel is provided to customize the **System Statistics** display by configuring the level information that can be viewed on the panel.

The following information can be configured:

-   **Statistics Refresh Interval (milliseconds):** Allows you to specify the interval of the statistics refresh. A smaller value refreshes the statistics display faster.
-   **Response Time Graph:** Allows you to specify the X and Y parameters of the **Response Time** graph.
    -   **X-Scale (units)**
    -   **X-Width (px)**
-   **Memory Graph** - Allows you to specify the X and Y parameters of the **Memory** graph.
    -   **X-Scale (units)**
    -   **X-Width (px)**

If you want to reset the previous values before submitting the page after editing, click **Reset** . The **Restore Defaults** button sets the default values in the corresponding fields.
