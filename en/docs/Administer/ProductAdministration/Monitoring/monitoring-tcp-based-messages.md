# Monitoring TCP-Based Messages

Users can view and monitor the messages passed along a TCP-based conversation using the TCPMon utility. Therefore, this is a convenient tool, particularly useful for debugging when you develop Web services. TCPMon is an Apache project distributed under [Apache 2.0 License](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html) .

TCPMon is not dependent on any third party libraries. Its user interface is based on a swing UI and works on almost all platforms that support Java.

# Starting TCPMon

TCPMon is available in the `<PRODUCT_HOME>/bin` directory of any WSO2 Carbon based product distribution. Alternatively, you can download TCPMon from Apache and run the tool.

-   [Running TCPMon (from Carbon product pack)](#StartingTCPMon-RunningTCPMon(fromCarbonproductpack))
-   [Running TCPMon (downloaded from Apache)](#StartingTCPMon-RunningTCPMon(downloadedfromApache))

### Running TCPMon (from Carbon product pack)

Ensure that the following prerequisites are fulfilled in order to run TCPMon.

-   Install JDK 1.4 or later version.
-   Set the `JAVA_HOME` variable. This setting is required only if you are using the TCPMon available in the WSO2 Carbon based product pack.

        !!! info
    For information on how to set the `JAVA_HOME` variable, go to [Installing the Product](https://docs.wso2.com/display/Carbon440/Installing+the+Product) , select the instructions relevant to your operating system and refer the 'Setting JAVA\_HOME' section.


To run the TCPMon available with your WSO2 Carbon product pack:

1.  Go to `<PRODUCT_HOME>/bin` directory of your product pack.
2.  Execute the following command to run the tool.
    For Windows

    ``` java
        tcpmon.bat
    ```

    For Linux

    ``` java
            ./tcpmon.sh
    ```

### Running TCPMon (downloaded from Apache)

To download TCPMon from Apache and run the tool:

1.  Download TCPMon from the following location: <http://archive.apache.org/dist/ws/tcpmon/1.0/tcpmon-1.0-bin.zip> .
2.  Extract tcpmon-1.0-bin.zip archive.
3.  Go to the build of the extracted directory to find the execution script.
4.  Execute the following command to run the tool.

    For Windows

    ``` java
            tcpmon.bat
    ```

    For Linux

    ``` java
            ./tcpmon.sh
    ```



# Other Usages of TCPMon

TCPMon is primarily used for message monitoring. Additionally, TCPMon can also be used for sending requests to web services and as a proxy service. Refer [Starting TCPMon](https://docs.wso2.com/display/Carbon440/Starting+TCPMon) for details on how to start the tool.

-   [Advanced Settings](#OtherUsagesofTCPMon-AdvancedSettings)

#### Sending Requests for Web Services

TCPMon can also be used as a request sender for Web services. The request SOAP message can be pasted on the send screen and sent directly to the server.

#### As a Proxy

TCPMon can act as a proxy. To start it in proxy mode, select the Proxy option. When acting as a proxy, TCPMon only needs the listener port to be configured.

#### Advanced Settings

TCPMon can simulate a slow connection, in which case the delay and the bytes to be dropped can be configured. This is useful when testing Web services.

Also, if HTTP proxy support is required, that can also be set on the admin screen.
