# Configuring a JDBC User Store

JDBC user stores can be configured using the <APIM_HOME>/repository/conf/deployment.toml file's [user_store] configuration section. The user core connects to two databases (the same database is utilized by default):

-   **User Management Database** - The database where authorization information is stored internally.
-   **User Store Database** - The user store database where users/roles reside.

You can either use the default configuration or you can change it in the following ways:

-   You can set up two separate databases for the Authorization Manager and the User Store Manager.
-   It is not recommended to use the default H2 database in production. Therefore, you can replace them with a different RDBMS. For instructions on setting up a new RDBMS and configuring it for your system, see [Setting Up Databases]({{base_path}}/InstallAndSetup/SettingUpDatabases/overview).

!!!tip
    Before you begin, ensure that the RDBMS that you want to use as the JDBC user store is correctly set up for your system. Then, follow the steps given below to configure a JDBC user store as the primary user store in your product.

### Step 1: Configuring the JDBC user store manager

1. To configure a JDBC user store as the primary user store, you must give the value: `database` for the config: `user_store.type` in the `<APIM_HOME>/repository/conf/deployment.toml` file.

    ```toml
        [user_store]
        type = "database"
    ```

2. By default the WSO2 API Manager uses a JDBC user store manager. This is an internal RDBMS. If you are willing to connect to an external RDBMS for the `database` user store type, you will have to define the following configurations along with the user store type. 

    ```toml
    [user_store.properties]
    TenantManager = "org.wso2.carbon.user.core.tenant.JDBCTenantManager"
    data_source = "WSO2USER_DB"
    Disabled = false
    MaxUserNameListLength = 100
    MaxRoleNameListLength = 100
    UserRolesCacheEnabled = true
    PasswordDigest = "SHA-256"
    ReadGroups = true
    ReadOnly = false
    IsEmailUserName = false
    DomainCalculation = "default"
    StoreSaltedPassword = true
    WriteGroups = false
    UserNameUniqueAcrossTenants = false
    PasswordJavaRegEx = "^[\\S]{5,30}$"
    PasswordJavaScriptRegEx = "^[\\S]{5,30}$"
    UsernameJavaRegEx = "^[\\S]{5,30}$"
    UsernameJavaScriptRegEx = "^[\\S]{5,30}$"
    RolenameJavaRegEx = "^[\\S]{5,30}$"
    RolenameJavaScriptRegEx = "^[\\S]{5,30}$"
    SCIMEnabled = false

    DomainName = "wso2.org"
    Description = "This is an external JDBC primary user store"
    ```

    !!! info
        The sample for the external JDBC user store configuration, consists of properties pertaining to various SQL statements. This is because the schema may be different for an external user store, and these adjustments need to be made in order to streamline the configurations with WSO2 products.

3.  Add the `PasswordHashMethod` property to the `UserStoreManager` configuration for `JDBCUserStoreManager` . For example:

    ``` toml
    [user_store.properties]
    ReadGroupsPasswordHashMethod = "SHA"
    ```

    The `PasswordHashMethod` property specifies how the password should be stored. It usually has the following values:

    - **SHA** - Uses SHA digest method.
    - **MD5** - Uses MD 5 digest method.
    - **PLAIN_TEXT** - Plain text passwords.

    In addition, it also supports all digest methods in <http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/security/MessageDigest.html> .

4.  If you are setting up an external JDBC user store, you need to set the following property to 'true' to be able to create roles in the primary user store.

    ``` toml
    [user_store.properties]
    WriteGroups = false
    ```

### Step 2: Updating the system administrator

The **admin** user is the super user that will be able to manage all other users, roles and permissions in the system by using the management console of the product. Therefore, the user that should have admin permissions is required to be stored in the user store when you start the system for the first time. If the JDBC user store is read-only, then we need to always use a user ID that is already in the user store as the super tenant. Otherwise, if the JDBC user store can be written to, you have the option of creating a new admin user in the user store when you start the system for the first time. These two alternative configurations can be done as explained below.

-   If the user store is read-only, find a valid user that already resides in the RDBMS. For example, say a the user store consists of a user: "adminUser". Update the `username` section of the `super_admin` configuration of the deployment.toml file, as shown below. You do not have to update the password element as it is already set in the user store. Since the user already exists in the user store, and the user store is read-only, `create_admin_account` should be set to `false`.

    ``` toml
    [super_admin]
    username = "adminUser"
    password = "XXXXXX"
    create_admin_account = false
    ```

-   If the user store can be written to, you can add the super tenant user to the user store. Therefore, `create_admin_account` should be set to `true` as shown below.

    ``` toml
    [super_admin]
    username = "adminUser"
    password = "adminpass"
    create_admin_account = true
    ```

In the realm configuration section, set the value of the `MultiTenantRealmConfigBuilder` property to `org.wso2.carbon.user.core.config.multitenancy.SimpleRealmConfigBuilder` in order to construct teant specific realm configurations.

For example:

``` toml
[realm_manager.properties]
MultiTenantRealmConfigBuilder = "org.wso2.carbon.user.core.config.multitenancy.SimpleRealmConfigBuilder"
```

### Step 3: Updating the datasources

Whenever there is an RDBMS set up for your system, it is necessary to create a corresponding datasource, which allows the system to connect to the database. The datasource for the internal H2 database that is shipped by default, is configured in the `deployment.toml` file, which is stored in the `<PRODUCT_HOME>/repository/conf` directory.

1. If you have replaced the default database with a new RDBMS, which you are now using as the JDBC user store, you have to update the `deployment.toml` file with the relevant information. This can be configured by adding the `database.user` config as shown below. 

    ```toml
    [database.user]
    type = "h2"
    url = "jdbc:h2:./repository/database/WSO2USER_DB;DB_CLOSE_ON_EXIT=FALSE"
    username = "wso2carbon"
    password = "wso2carbon"

    [database.user.pool_options]
    maxActive = 50
    maxWait = 60000
    testOnBorrow = true
    validationInterval = 30000
    defaultAutoCommit = true
    ```

2.  Now, the datasource configuration and the user store manager RDBMS configuration should be linked together.
    -   By default, the database that is used for persisting user authorization information is the SHARED_DB. Also, by default this is the datasource used for the primary JDBC userstore as well. If you are willing to change both the user management database and the primary userstore, the following configuration will be sufficient.  
    
        ```toml
        [realm_manager]
        data_source = "WSO2USER_DB"
        ```

    -   However, if you have set up an external RDBMS as the primary user store, instead of a common RDBMS for both, the user management and the user store, you must configure the datasource for this external user store as follows.

        ```toml
        [user_store.properties]
        data_source = "WSO2USER_DB"
        ```

        !!! note
            This configuration is already added to the external primary user store configuration given in the second step.

### Step 4: Starting the server

1.  Add the JDBC driver to the classpath by copying its JAR file into the `<PRODUCT_HOME>/repository/components/lib` directory.
2.  Start the server.
