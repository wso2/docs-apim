| **Error Code** | **Detail**                                                                                            |

| 101508         | Request to establish new connection timed out                                                         |

| 101510         | Response processing failed                                                                            |

If the HTTP PassThrough transport is used, and a connection-level error
occurs, the error code is calculated using the following equation:

``` java
Error code = Base error code + Protocol State
```

The sender side of the transport matches the protocol state, which
changes according to the phase of the message.

Following are the possible protocol states and the description for each:

| Protocol State     | Description                                                |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| REQUEST_READY (0) | Connection is at the initial stage ready to send a request |
| REQUEST_HEAD(1)   | Sending the request headers through the connection         |
| REQUEST_BODY(2)   | Sending the request body                                   |
| REQUEST_DONE(3)   | Request is completely sent                                 |
| RESPONSE_HEAD(4)  | The connection is reading the response headers             |
| RESPONSE_BODY(5)  | The connection is reading the response body                |
| RESPONSE_DONE(6)  | The response is completed                                  |
| CLOSING(7)         | The connection is closing                                  |
| CLOSED(8)          | The connection is closed                                   |

Since there are several possible protocol states in which a request can
time out, you can calculate the error code accordingly using the values
in the table above. For example, in a scenario where you send a request
and the request is completely sent to the backend, but aÂ timeout happens
before the response headers are received, the error code is calculated
as follows:

In this scenario, the base error code is
`         CONNECTION_TIMEOUT(101504)        ` and the protocol state is
`         REQUEST_DONE(3).        `

Therefore, Error code = 101504 + 3 = 101507

## Endpoint Error Codes

## Custom Error Codes

| **Error Code** |   **Detail**                                                                                    |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 500000         | Endpoint Custom Error - This error is triggered when the endpoint is prefixed by `<property>name="FORCE_ERROR_ON_SOAP_FAULT" value="true"/>`, which enhances the failover logic by marking an endpoint as suspended when the response is a SOAP fault. |
