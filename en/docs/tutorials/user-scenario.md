Union Station is a major multimodal railway transportation hub. It is one of the busiest stations in the country and serves more than thousands of passengers a day. The train shed, platforms and tracks are owned by GOGO transit, and they operate the station. Trains are owned by the companies named Quantis, ColTrain and RailCo. To provide a digital ecosystem, all four companies are planning to develop their day to day business operations with WSO2 technology. These development ranges from providing different kinds of APIs to external/internal users, providing real time notifications, stream data processing, integrating with partners/external systems etc.

This tutorial will demonstrate how WSO2 technology can be used to cater to their different  requirements.
