# OpenID Connect Discovery

WSO2 API Manager supports OpenID Connect Discovery to discover an end user's OpenID provider, and also to obtain information required to interact with the OpenID provider, including its OAuth 2.0 endpoint locations, by exposing an API in the Gateway.

The OpenID Connect discovery endpoint is as follows:

`https://<gateway_hostname>:<port>/oidcdiscovery/.well-known/openid-configuration`

You can obtain openid-configuration information as a payload by invoking the openid-configuration endpoint. The format of the cURL command and a sample is given below:

**Sample Request**

``` bash tab="Format"
curl -v -k https://<gateway_hostname>:<port>/oidcdiscovery/.well-known/openid-configuration
```

``` bash tab="Example"
curl -v -k https://localhost:8243/oidcdiscovery/.well-known/openid-configuration

```
