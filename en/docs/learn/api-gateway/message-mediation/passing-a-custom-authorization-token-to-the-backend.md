# Passing a Custom Authorization Token to the Backend

When you send an API request to the backend, you pass a token in the `Authorization` header of the request. 
The API Gateway uses this token to authorize access, and then drops it from the outgoing message.  If you wish to use a 
different (or a custom generated) authorization token than the application generated access token, you can use it as a 
token exchange mechanism in mediation logic of the API. In this tutorial, we explain how to pass a custom authorization 
token that is different to the authorization token generated for the application.

In this tutorial, you have a sample JAX-RS backend and it always expects 1234 as the authorization token. In your API 
request, you pass the token that is generated in the `Authorization` header, and 1234 in a `Custom` header. 
The mediation extension you write extracts the value of the `Custom` header, and sets it as the `Authorization` header 
before sending it to the backend.

Here's a summary:

`Client (headers: Authorization, custom) -> Gateway (drop: Authorization, convert: custom->Authorization) -> Backend                     `

1.  Add the following sequence content in to a file and save it as XML file.

    !!! example
        ```xml
        <sequence xmlns="http://ws.apache.org/ns/synapse" name="TokenExchange">
            <property name="Custom" expression="get-property('transport', 'Custom')"/>
            <property name="Authorization" expression="get-property('Custom')" scope="transport"/>
            <property name="Custom" scope="transport" action="remove"/>
        </sequence>
        ```

2.  Log in to the **API Publisher**, create a new REST API with the information given in the table below by following the instructions in [Create a REST API]({{base_path}}/learn/design-api/create-api/create-a-rest-api/).

    | Field         | Sample value         |
    |---------------|----------------------|
    | Name          | TestCustomHeader     |
    | Context       | /testcustomheader    |
    | Version       | 1.0.0                |
    | Business Plan | Gold                 |
    | Endpoint      | http://wso2cloud-custom-auth-header-sample-1-0-0.wso2apps.com/custom-auth-header/validate-header |

3.  Navigate to the **Runtime Configurations** tab, enable the **Message Mediation** in Request flow. Engage the `In` 
sequence that you created earlier and click **Save** .

4. If the API is not in `PUBLISHED` state, go to **Lifecycle** tab, click **REDPLOY** to re-publish the API. 

5. Go **Developer Portal**, subscribe and obtain a token to invoke the published API. 

    !!! tip
        Follow the instructions in [here]({{base_path}}/learn/consume-api/manage-application/generate-keys/generate-api-keys/#generate-application-keys) to generate an application access token.  

6. Install any REST client in your machine. We use [cURL](http://curl.haxx.se/download.html) here.

7. Go to the command line, and invoke the API using the following cURL command.   
In this command, you pass the token that 
the backend expects, i.e., 1234, in the **`Custom`** header with the authorization token that the system generates in 
the **`Authorization`** header.

    !!! example

        ``` bash tab="Template"
        curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <access token>" -H "Custom: Bearer 1234" <API URL>
        ```

        ``` bash tab="Sample"
        curl -k -H "Authorization: Bearer 2e25097b2b3fbbfb44f5642fa8a495a1" -H "Custom: Bearer 1234" https://localhost:8243/testcustomheader/1.0.0
        ```

    !!! info
        -   **<access token&gt;** is the token that you got in step 20.
        -   **<API URL&gt;** appears on the API's **Overview** page in the API Developer Portal. Copy the HTTP endpoint. 
            If you select the HTTPs endpoint, be sure to run the cURL command with the -k option.

24. Note the response that you get in the command line. According to the sample backend used in this tutorial, 
you get the response as "Request Received."

In this tutorial, you passed a custom token that the backend expects along with the system-generated Authorization token, and invoked an API successfully by swapping the system's token with your custom token.
