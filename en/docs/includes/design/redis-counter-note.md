    - **[Configure Rate Limiting for the API Gateway Cluster](https://apim.docs.wso2.com/en/4.1.0/design/rate-limiting/advanced-topics/configuring-rate-limiting-api-gateway-cluster)** so that the request counters will be replicated across the API Gateway cluster when working with multiple API Gateway nodes. 
    - Configuring Rate Limiting for the API Gateway cluster is not applicable if you have a clustered setup.
