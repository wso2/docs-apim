# Defining Endpoints in an OpenAPI Definition

You can use an existing OpenAPI definition to create an API project using APICTL, and deploy that project directly to Choreo Connect. When following this path, the endpoints must be included in the OpenAPI definition itself, so that the inbound request of Choreo Connect can be routed to the corresponding backend service. You, as a developer, can state the endpoint URLs for, 

- the whole API or 
- a particular resource 

depending on the requirement. In addition, you can state the corresponding environment (i.e., production or sandbox) as well.

### API Level Endpoints

It is mandatory for you to define the API Level endpoint at the root level of your OpenAPI definition at the design time. However, if you have defined resource level endpoints for all the resources, then defining an API Level endpoint is not necessary. For resources without a specific endpoint, the inbound traffic is automatically routed to the provided API level endpoint.

``` yaml tab="Format"
.
.
info:
.
.
x-wso2-basePath: <base_path>
x-wso2-production-endpoints:
    urls: 
    - <API_level_endpoint>
x-wso2-sandbox-endpoints:
    urls:
    - <API_level_endpoint>
security:
- petstore_auth : []
```

``` yaml tab="Example"
.
.
info:
  version: 1.0.5
  title: PizzaShackAPI
x-wso2-basePath: /v2
x-wso2-production-endpoints:
    urls: 
    - https://localhost:2380/v2
x-wso2-sandbox-endpoints:
    urls:
    - https://localhost:2380/v2
security:
- petstore_auth : []

```

### Resource Level Endpoints

In Choreo Connect, you can define different endpoint URLs for different resources within the same OpenAPI definition. Defining an endpoint under a resource in the OpenAPI definition, will make the endpoint a resource level endpoint. When the traffic comes in for a particular resource, it will be routed based on the endpoint configuration under the resource, and not according to the API level endpoint configuration.

``` yaml tab="Format"
.
.
info:
.
.
x-wso2-basePath: 
x-wso2-production-endpoints:
    urls:
    - 
paths:
    /pet/findByStatus:
        x-wso2-production-endpoints:
            urls:
            - 
        x-wso2-sandbox-endpoints:
            urls:
            -
        get:
    /pet/{petId}:
        get:
.
. 
```

``` yaml tab="Example"
.
.
info:
.
.
x-wso2-basePath: 
x-wso2-production-endpoints:
    urls:
    - 
paths:
    /pet/findByStatus:
        x-wso2-production-endpoints:
            urls:
            -  https://localhost:2380/v1 
        get:
            tags:
            - pets
            summary: Finds Pets by status
            description: Multiple status values can be provided with comma separated strings
            operationId: findPetsByStatus
            parameters:
            - name: status
              in: query
              description: Status values that need to be considered for filter
        .
        .
    /pet/{petId}:
        get:
.
.
```

In the above example `/pet/findByStatus` resource has a separate endpoint configuration compared to the `/pet/{petId}` resource. Therefore, the inbound traffic for the `/pet/findByStatus` resource are routed based on its specific endpoint object, whereas the requests coming to the `/pet/{petId}` resource are routed to the API Level endpoint.

### Endpoint Objects

An endpoint can either belong to a production environment or sandbox environment. Therefore, an endpoint is listed under the extension ` x-wso2-production-endpoints` or `x-wso2-sandbox-endpoints` accordingly.

The following is the basic structure of an endpoint.

``` yaml
x-wso2-production-endpoints:
    urls:
    - <endpoint_URL>
```

The purpose of URLs field is to include the backend service URLs. .

If you have added resource level endpoints and you have repeated the same endpoint in multiple resources, it will cause data duplication in the OpenAPI definition. In order to avoid repitition, the endpoints can be provided under a reference model as shown below. 

``` yaml tab="Format"
paths:
    /pet/findByStatus:
        x-wso2-production-endpoints: "#/x-wso2-endpoints/<endpoint-name>"
        get:
            tags:
            - 
            summary: 
            description: 
            operationId: 
.
.
x-wso2-endpoints:
- myEndpoint:
    urls:
    - <endpoint-URL-1>
    - <endpoint-URL-2>
```

``` yaml tab="Example"
paths:
    /pet/findByStatus:
        x-wso2-production-endpoints: "#/x-wso2-endpoints/myEndpoint1"
        get:
            tags:
            - pet
            summary: Finds Pets by status
            description: Multiple status values can be provided with comma separated strings
            operationId: findPetsByStatus
.
.
x-wso2-endpoints:
- myEndpoint1:
    urls:
    - https://localhost:2380/v1
- myEndpoint2:
    urls:
    - https://localhost:2380/v2
- myEndpoint3:
    urls:
    - https://localhost:2380/v1
    - https://localhost:2380/v2
    - myEndpoint4:
```
