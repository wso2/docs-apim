# Deploy an API to Choreo Connect

There are two ways to add an API to Choreo Connect.

1. [Via API Manager]({{base_path}}/deploy-and-publish/deploy-on-gateway/choreo-connect/deploy-api/depoly-api-via-apim)

    By enabling the Control Plane Event Hub in the Choreo Connect configuration file, the APIs deployed in API Manager will automatically be available in Choreo Connect. 

2. [Via the CLI tool (apictl)]({{base_path}}/deploy-and-publish/deploy-on-gateway/choreo-connect/deploy-api/deploy-api-via-apictl)

    If you are not using WSO2 API Manager yet, or want to try out Choreo Connect as a standalone gateway, simply use the CLI tool [apictl](https://github.com/wso2/product-apim-tooling/releases) to host your API.
