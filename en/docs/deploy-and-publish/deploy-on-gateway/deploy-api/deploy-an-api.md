# Deploy an API

**API Deploying** is the process of making the API available for invocation via a gateway. You can deploy an API to a selected API Gateway environment via the Publisher Portal. To invoke an API, it needs to be PUBLISHED on the developer portal as well as deployed on a gateway environment. You need to create a revision of an API in order to deploy it.

**Undeploying an API**  will remove the API from the API Gateway Environment.

Follow the steps below to deploy an API using WSO2 API Manager.
